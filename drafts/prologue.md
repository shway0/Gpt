# Prologue: Echoes of the Forgotten

The sky burned.

Not with the familiar warmth of sunrise or the gentle glow of sunset, but with the unnatural brilliance of reality itself in flux. Fractures spread across the heavens like cracks in ancient porcelain, revealing glimpses of something beyond—a void that was neither darkness nor light but the absence of both.

Master Luo Wei ran through the collapsing corridors of the Boundless Meridian Sect, clutching a crystal sphere to his chest. Behind him, the thunderous crash of falling stone mingled with the screams of disciples caught in spatial ruptures. The ground beneath his feet buckled and heaved as reality itself rejected the principles upon which their cultivation was founded.

"Seal the eastern compound!" he shouted to a group of senior disciples struggling to maintain a protective formation. "The void fractures are spreading faster there!"

"Master Luo!" A blood-streaked disciple intercepted him, grabbing his sleeve. "The Order's enforcers have breached the outer gates. They're demanding your surrender!"

Luo Wei shook his head, never slowing his pace. "They still believe they can control this. Even now, with the world literally breaking apart around them."

He reached the base of the sect's highest tower and paused, his aged hand pressing against the wall to steady himself as another violent tremor shook the compound. Through a shattered window, he could see the main courtyard where a massive tear in reality had appeared—a void fracture that consumed everything it touched. Three disciples ventured too close and simply ceased to exist, their accumulated spiritual energy devoured in an instant.

"Master!" A young woman appeared at his side—Disciple Mei, one of the few who had truly understood his research. Her robes were torn, her face streaked with ash, but her eyes remained clear and focused. "The library is gone. The entire eastern wing collapsed."

"It doesn't matter," Luo Wei replied, holding up the crystal sphere. Its surface was etched with formations so intricate they appeared as mere texture to the untrained eye. "Everything essential is here. The complete Inverse Meridian Theory—not just the texts they banned, but the techniques, the applications, everything they tried to suppress."

"Then we must get you to safety," Mei insisted, glancing nervously toward the main gates where shouts and the clash of spiritual weapons indicated the Order's enforcers were fighting their way in. "There are still paths through the western forest—"

"No." Luo Wei's voice was firm. "I'm not leaving."

"But Master—"

"Listen to me, Mei." He gripped her shoulder with surprising strength for his age. "This cataclysm is only the beginning. When it ends—if it ends—the Order will rewrite history. They'll blame those who warned against their excesses rather than admit their own role in this disaster."

Another tremor, stronger than before, sent cracks racing up the tower walls. From outside came the sound of shattering crystal as another protective formation failed.

"Take this." Luo Wei pressed a jade token into Mei's hand. "It contains coordinates—a place in what will become the most unstable region. That's where I'll send the sphere."

"You're staying behind," Mei realized, her voice breaking. "To ensure the knowledge survives."

"Someone must." Luo Wei smiled sadly. "And someone must remember where to find it, when the time is right."

The tower entrance exploded inward in a shower of stone and spiritual energy. Through the dust stepped three figures in the distinctive black robes of the Order's enforcers, their faces hidden behind masks of polished bone.

"Master Luo Wei," the lead enforcer called, his voice distorted by his mask. "By authority of the Order of Sixfold Balance, you are commanded to surrender all materials related to the heretical Inverse Meridian Theory."

Luo Wei pushed Mei behind him, toward a concealed exit at the rear of the chamber. "Go," he whispered. "Live. Remember."

She hesitated only a moment before slipping away, clutching the jade token to her chest.

Luo Wei turned to face the enforcers, the crystal sphere now glowing faintly in his hands as he activated its formations. "You're too late," he said calmly. "The balance is already broken."

"Surrender the sphere, heretic," the enforcer demanded, advancing with a spiritual weapon manifested—a spear of concentrated energy that hummed with destructive potential.

"You fear inversion because it mirrors you," Luo Wei replied, his fingers tracing final activations across the sphere's surface. "But the world will forget your control before it forgets its hunger."

The lead enforcer lunged forward, but Luo Wei was already moving. With a precise technique born from decades of cultivation, he cast the crystal sphere upward, through a gap in the collapsing ceiling. As it arced through the burning sky, he performed a final technique—a spatial displacement that would send the sphere beyond the immediate range of destruction, to the coordinates he had given Mei.

The enforcer's spear pierced Luo Wei's chest in the same moment, its spiritual energy disrupting his cultivation core. But it was too late—the sphere had vanished, its precious contents preserved against the cataclysm.

"What have you done?" the enforcer demanded, twisting the weapon.

Luo Wei smiled through the pain, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. "Ensured that your victory will be temporary."

The tower gave a final, catastrophic shudder. Stone and crystal rained down as the structure began to collapse entirely. The enforcers looked up in alarm, their mission forgotten in the face of immediate danger.

"When the Path must be walked again," Luo Wei said, making no move to escape as the ceiling began to fall, "it will not be by the proud or the blessed. It will be by the one who was never chosen."

The tower collapsed in a roar of destruction, burying both Luo Wei and the enforcers beneath tons of spiritually-infused stone. Outside, the cataclysm intensified, void fractures spreading across the landscape like hungry mouths, devouring everything they touched.

Disciples who had spent decades accumulating spiritual energy found their powers failing or turning against them. Protective formations that had stood for centuries shattered like glass. The very air seemed to crystallize and crack, revealing glimpses of the void beyond.

In the forest west of the compound, Disciple Mei ran, the jade token clutched in her hand, tears streaming down her face as she felt her master's death through their spiritual connection. Behind her, the Boundless Meridian Sect—once the greatest center of cultivation research in the world—disappeared in a maelstrom of collapsing reality.

The cataclysm lasted seven days.

People would later say the earth itself screamed—a sound beyond hearing that resonated in the bones and spiritual cores of every living being. Mountains crumbled. Oceans boiled and receded. Spiritual constructs that had stood for millennia disintegrated in moments.

Memory itself became unstable in the regions most affected. Cultivators forgot the names of their children before the ground beneath their feet stopped shaking. Others found themselves remembering events that had never occurred, or that had happened to someone else entirely.

When the destruction finally subsided, the world remained, but profoundly altered. Entire regions had been transformed into twisted landscapes where reality followed new and unstable rules. Sects that had stood for millennia were gone, their accumulated spiritual energy having attracted the worst of the void fractures.

From this chaos, the Order of Sixfold Balance emerged as the architect of recovery. They established new principles of cultivation, new hierarchies of power, new boundaries between what was permitted and what was forbidden. Under their guidance, the cultivation world slowly rebuilt itself, adapting to the changed reality while carefully controlling knowledge of what had come before.

The cataclysm was reframed in official histories—not as the inevitable consequence of cultivation imbalance, but as an external catastrophe, an unforeseeable disaster that the wise leadership of the Order had guided humanity through. The Inverse Meridian Theory was purged from all records, its proponents executed as heretics whose dangerous ideas had caused the disaster.

In the region most severely affected by the cataclysm—now known as the Shattered Wastes—reality remained unstable for centuries. Void fractures opened and closed unpredictably. Spiritual energy flowed in patterns that defied conventional understanding. Those who ventured there either perished or returned changed, speaking of experiences that the Order classified as delusions or void-madness.

Few connected these phenomena to the banned theories of Master Luo Wei, whose name had been methodically erased from cultivation history. His crystal sphere, containing the complete Inverse Meridian Theory, lay buried beneath the twisted landscape of the Wastes, its formations preserving the knowledge within while rendering it undetectable to conventional spiritual senses.

There it remained, waiting. For the right moment. For the right person.

For someone empty enough to receive what had been forgotten.

Eight centuries after the cataclysm, in the servant quarters of Azure Peaks Sect, a young man named Wei Liang woke with a gasp, his body drenched in cold sweat. He had dreamed of burning skies and a man casting a crystal sphere through fractures in reality. The dream had been so vivid he could still feel the heat of destruction on his skin, still hear the man's final words echoing in his mind:

*"It will not be by the proud or the blessed. It will be by the one who was never chosen."*

Wei sat up on his thin sleeping mat, heart racing despite years of training himself to suppress all strong emotion. He pressed his palms against his eyes, trying to push away the lingering images—the collapsing tower, the black-robed enforcers, the crystal sphere arcing through a shattered sky.

A sudden knock at his door made him jump.

"Wei! Are you awake?" It was Liu, another servant disciple. "Elder Feng is asking for the expedition volunteers. They're finalizing the roster today."

"I'll be right there," Wei called back, his voice steadier than he felt.

He rose and splashed water on his face from the small basin beside his mat. As he dressed in the plain gray robes that marked him as a servant disciple, he tried to dismiss the dream as nothing more than anxiety about the upcoming expedition to the Shattered Wastes.

Such expeditions were rare and dangerous, venturing into the most unstable region left by the cataclysm in search of artifacts and insights from the Forgotten Age. Wei had volunteered as support staff—a decision that had drawn curious looks from the few who noticed it. Servant disciples typically avoided such dangerous assignments.

But Wei had his reasons, though he shared them with no one.

Born without spiritual roots, he had spent his life invisible within a world that valued only cultivation potential. Yet in that invisibility, he had found opportunity—access to texts and conversations that others overlooked, freedom to study what interested him rather than following prescribed paths.

For years, he had secretly pieced together fragments of knowledge, building an understanding of cultivation principles despite his inability to implement them directly. The Wastes represented his only chance to find a path not closed to him by birth—a path that might exist in the one place where conventional rules broke down.

As he left his small room and headed toward the main hall where volunteers were gathering, Wei felt the dream's grip on him loosen. Dreams were irrelevant. Only action mattered. In three days, the expedition would depart for the Shattered Wastes, and he would either find what he sought or perish in the attempt.

Either outcome would be preferable to remaining invisible forever.

Unknown to Wei, beneath the twisted landscape of his destination, a crystal sphere pulsed faintly, its formations sensing the approach of the moment they had been designed to await. After eight centuries of silence, the preserved knowledge of the Inverse Meridian Theory—the Forgotten Path—stirred in anticipation of finally being found.

The cycle prepared to begin anew. Not as repetition, but as inversion.

What had been forgotten would be remembered. What had been suppressed would emerge. What had been unmade would be remade.

And the cultivation world would never be the same.
