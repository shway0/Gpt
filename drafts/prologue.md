# Prologue: Echoes of the Forgotten

The sky burned.

Not with the familiar warmth of sunrise or the gentle glow of sunset, but with the unnatural brilliance of reality itself in flux. Fractures spread across the heavens like cracks in ancient porcelain, revealing glimpses of something beyond—a void that was neither darkness nor light but the absence of both.

Master Luo Wei stood atop the highest tower of the Boundless Meridian Sect, his aged hands gripping the balustrade as he watched the world end. Behind him, disciples rushed to activate protective formations, their voices tight with panic despite years of cultivation discipline. The spiritual energy that had once flowed in orderly currents through the sect grounds now surged in chaotic waves, disrupting techniques that had functioned flawlessly for centuries.

"It's too late," Luo Wei murmured, though no one remained close enough to hear. "The balance is already broken."

He had warned them—all of them. The Conclave of Sects, the Order of Sixfold Balance, even the reclusive Immortals who rarely concerned themselves with mortal affairs. For decades, he had presented his research, demonstrating how the cultivation world's relentless pursuit of spiritual accumulation was creating dangerous instabilities in the fundamental fabric of reality.

They had dismissed him as alarmist. Called his theories heretical. Banned his texts and forbidden his teaching.

Now, as reality itself began to unravel, vindication brought no satisfaction.

A particularly violent tremor shook the tower, sending hairline cracks racing through stone reinforced by centuries of spiritual infusion. Below, in the main courtyard, a spatial rupture had appeared—a tear in reality that revealed the void beyond. Disciples who ventured too close simply ceased to exist, their accumulated spiritual energy consumed in an instant.

Luo Wei closed his eyes, focusing his awareness inward. After a lifetime of cultivation, his spiritual core resembled a vast ocean—deep, powerful, and ordinarily as stable as the foundations of the world itself. Now, even this internal landscape showed signs of the external chaos, ripples disturbing the once-perfect stillness.

He had one final responsibility. One last service to a world that had rejected his warnings.

From within his robes, Luo Wei withdrew a small object—a crystal sphere no larger than a plum, its surface etched with formations so intricate they appeared as mere texture to the untrained eye. Within the sphere, a swirling mist contained the distilled essence of his life's research: the Inverse Meridian Theory.

Not merely the texts that had been banned, but the complete understanding—the techniques, the principles, the applications that he had never dared commit to writing. Knowledge that offered an alternative to the accumulative model of cultivation that had dominated for millennia. Knowledge that might, in the right hands, provide a path forward from the catastrophe now unfolding.

"The path must not be forgotten," he whispered, infusing the crystal with the last measure of his spiritual energy. The formations activated, sealing the knowledge within—not to hide it, but to preserve it against the coming cataclysm.

With a precise movement born from decades of cultivation, Luo Wei cast the crystal sphere outward, away from the sect, away from the spreading void fractures. As it arced through the burning sky, he performed a final technique—a spatial displacement that would send the sphere beyond the immediate range of destruction, to a location where it might eventually be found.

Not soon. The knowledge it contained was too dangerous to be discovered while the wounds of the cataclysm were still fresh. But someday, when the cultivation world had rebuilt itself, when new hierarchies and orthodoxies had calcified into unquestioned truth—then, perhaps, someone would find his legacy.

Someone who would understand that cultivation was not merely accumulation but also consumption. Not just creation but unmaking. Not solely light but also void.

The crystal vanished into the distance as another, larger tremor shook the tower. Cracks spread through the structure, spiritual reinforcements failing as reality itself rejected the principles upon which they were founded.

Luo Wei made no move to flee. His role was finished. He had preserved what needed to survive, and the rest—himself included—belonged to the ending world.

As the tower began to collapse beneath him, he caught a final glimpse of the burning sky. The fractures had spread further, revealing more of the void beyond. Yet within that seeming emptiness, he perceived something his research had led him to suspect but never confirm: patterns. Structure. Purpose.

The void was not merely absence. It was another form of presence—one that operated by principles inverse to those the cultivation world had embraced.

Luo Wei smiled as the tower gave way. His final thought, as both his physical form and spiritual core dispersed into the cataclysm, was not of fear or regret but of profound curiosity.

What would grow from these ashes?

The cataclysm lasted seven days.

When it finally subsided, the world remained, but profoundly altered. Entire regions had been transformed into twisted landscapes where reality followed new and unstable rules. Sects that had stood for millennia were gone, their accumulated spiritual energy having attracted the worst of the void fractures. Cultivation techniques that had reliably produced results for generations now failed unpredictably or yielded dangerous side effects.

From this chaos, the Order of Sixfold Balance emerged as the architect of recovery. They established new principles of cultivation, new hierarchies of power, new boundaries between what was permitted and what was forbidden. Under their guidance, the cultivation world slowly rebuilt itself, adapting to the changed reality while carefully controlling knowledge of what had come before.

The cataclysm was reframed in official histories—not as the inevitable consequence of cultivation imbalance, but as an external catastrophe, an unforeseeable disaster that the wise leadership of the Order had guided humanity through. The Inverse Meridian Theory was purged from all records, its proponents dismissed as deluded heretics whose dangerous ideas had perished with them.

In the region most severely affected by the cataclysm—now known as the Shattered Wastes—reality remained unstable for centuries. Void fractures opened and closed unpredictably. Spiritual energy flowed in patterns that defied conventional understanding. Those who ventured there either perished or returned changed, speaking of experiences that the Order classified as delusions or void-madness.

Few connected these phenomena to the banned theories of Master Luo Wei, whose name had been methodically erased from cultivation history. His crystal sphere, containing the complete Inverse Meridian Theory, lay buried beneath the twisted landscape of the Wastes, its formations preserving the knowledge within while rendering it undetectable to conventional spiritual senses.

There it remained, waiting. For the right moment. For the right person.

For someone empty enough to receive what had been forgotten.

Eight centuries after the cataclysm, in the servant quarters of Azure Peaks Sect, a young man named Wei Liang woke from a dream of burning skies and voices speaking from the void. He sat up on his thin sleeping mat, heart racing despite years of training himself to suppress all strong emotion.

The dream had been unusually vivid—not the standard spiritual impressions that occasionally affected even rootless servants in a cultivation sect, but something that felt almost like memory. Which was impossible, of course. No one remembered the cataclysm; it existed only in carefully curated historical texts that someone of his station had no business reading.

Yet as Wei prepared for another day of invisible service, the dream lingered—particularly the final image of a crystal sphere arcing through a fractured sky, carrying something precious away from destruction.

He dismissed the imagery as his mind processing fragments of overheard conversations about the upcoming expedition to the Shattered Wastes. Such expeditions were rare and dangerous, venturing into the most unstable region left by the cataclysm in search of artifacts and insights from the Forgotten Age.

Wei had volunteered as support staff for the expedition—a decision that had surprised the few who noticed it. Servant disciples typically avoided such dangerous assignments. But Wei had his reasons, though he shared them with no one.

Dreams of burning skies aside, he had spent years secretly studying whatever texts he could access, building a patchwork understanding of cultivation principles despite being born without spiritual roots. The Wastes represented his only chance to find a path not closed to him by birth—a path that might exist in the one place where conventional rules broke down.

As he began his morning duties, Wei pushed the dream from his mind. Dreams were irrelevant. Only action mattered. In three days, the expedition would depart for the Shattered Wastes, and he would either find what he sought or perish in the attempt.

Either outcome would be preferable to remaining invisible forever.

Unknown to Wei, beneath the twisted landscape of his destination, a crystal sphere pulsed faintly, its formations sensing the approach of the moment they had been designed to await. After eight centuries of silence, the preserved knowledge of the Inverse Meridian Theory—the Forgotten Path—stirred in anticipation of finally being found.

The cycle prepared to begin anew. Not as repetition, but as inversion.

What had been forgotten would be remembered. What had been suppressed would emerge. What had been unmade would be remade.

And the cultivation world would never be the same.
