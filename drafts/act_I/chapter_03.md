# Chapter 3: The Expedition Departs

The morning of the expedition's departure dawned with unusual clarity over Azure Peaks Sect. The typically misty mountain air had cleared overnight, revealing a sharp blue sky that seemed to mock the tension permeating the assembly area. Wei Liang arrived before sunrise, having spent most of the night meticulously preparing his assigned equipment—checking straps on supply packs, verifying the contents of medicine pouches, and ensuring the preservation talismans on food containers were properly activated.

He stood now at the edge of the gathering, invisible as always despite being in plain sight. Twenty disciples had been selected for the expedition to the Shattered Wastes—five inner disciples with significant combat experience, ten outer disciples with specialized skills, and five servant disciples to handle logistics and support. The hierarchy was clearly visible in their positioning: inner disciples at the center of the formation, outer disciples arranged in a protective ring, servants relegated to the periphery with the supply carts.

Wei observed the inner disciples with careful neutrality. Each wore the full azure robes that marked their status, spiritual weapons prominently displayed, postures radiating the confidence of those who had never questioned their place in the world. He recognized all five—had served them tea, cleaned their quarters, stood motionless while they discussed sect matters as if he were merely furniture.

Disciple Jian Rou, the expedition leader, paced at the center of the formation. Her spirit blade, Azure Fang, hung at her waist—a legendary weapon that had been wielded by her master, Elder Lian Hesh, before being passed down upon Jian's advancement to peak inner disciple status. The blade's azure sheath occasionally emitted a faint glow as it resonated with its wielder's agitation.

"The final supply inventory is incomplete," Jian announced, her voice carrying the crisp authority of someone accustomed to immediate obedience. "Who was responsible for the preservation talismans?"

Wei stepped forward before the designated servant disciple could speak. "This one has verified all preservation talismans, Senior Sister Jian," he said, using the formal address despite knowing she had never once acknowledged him as a junior disciple of the same sect. "The inventory was completed during the night watch and placed on your desk as requested."

Jian's eyes passed over Wei without recognition, then narrowed slightly. "You are?"

"Wei Liang, Senior Sister. Assigned to expedition support."

She frowned, clearly trying to place him within her mental hierarchy of the sect. "You're not the disciple I instructed yesterday."

"Senior Brother Liu fell ill during the night. This one was assigned as replacement." This was not entirely true—Wei had spent weeks carefully arranging to be included in the expedition, culminating in convincing Liu that a stomach ailment had befallen him through subtle application of herbs in the communal servant meal.

Jian seemed about to question further when Elder Feng approached, ending the interaction. The elder's arrival shifted everyone's attention, disciples straightening their postures and adjusting their expressions to show appropriate respect.

"The Sect Leader sends his blessing for your expedition," Elder Feng announced, his weathered face solemn. "You carry the reputation of Azure Peaks into the Wastes. Remember your training, maintain formation discipline, and adhere to the expedition protocols."

He produced a jade tablet inscribed with complex formations—the expedition authorization that would be recognized by other sects and would record the group's findings for later analysis. "Senior Disciple Jian, as expedition leader, this responsibility falls to you."

Jian accepted the tablet with a formal bow. "Azure Peaks will not be disappointed, Elder."

Elder Feng nodded, then addressed the assembled disciples. "The Shattered Wastes remain the most dangerous territory in our region. The cataclysm's effects linger there more strongly than anywhere else. Reality itself is unstable. You have all been briefed on the specific phenomena to expect, but be prepared for the unexpected."

His gaze swept across the formation, lingering momentarily on the servant disciples. "Every member of this expedition represents Azure Peaks Sect. Even those in support roles must maintain discipline and follow orders precisely. The Wastes do not discriminate between inner disciples and servants when they claim lives."

Wei kept his expression carefully neutral, though something in the elder's tone suggested he had noticed Wei's last-minute substitution. Whether he approved or simply didn't consider it worth addressing remained unclear.

"Your primary objective," Elder Feng continued, "is to locate and retrieve artifacts from the Forgotten Age that survived the cataclysm. Secondary objectives include mapping changes in the Wastes since our last expedition and observing any unusual spiritual phenomena. Tertiary objective is to assess recent reports of increased Order activity in the region."

This last point caused a subtle shift in the disciples' attention. The Order of Sixfold Balance rarely took direct interest in sect expeditions unless something significant had drawn their attention.

"You depart with the morning bell," Elder Feng concluded. "May your cultivation serve you well."

As the elder departed, the expedition members returned to their final preparations. Wei moved efficiently among the supply carts, double-checking his earlier work while listening to the conversations around him. The mention of Order activity had sparked speculation among the outer disciples, their voices low but carrying in the clear morning air.

"Three Order representatives were seen at the eastern edge of the Wastes last month," one outer disciple murmured. "Enforcer-class cultivators, not just observers."

"I heard they were tracking someone," another replied. "A rogue cultivator who ventured too deep into restricted territories."

"Or something," a third added. "My cousin at Emerald Summit Sect said they've increased patrols along all Waste boundaries. Whatever they're concerned about, it's not isolated."

Wei absorbed this information without visible reaction, though internally he noted its potential significance. Increased Order activity meant heightened scrutiny, which could complicate his personal objectives. He would need to be even more careful about separating from the main group when they reached the Wastes.

The morning bell rang, its deep resonance echoing across the mountain. Disciples moved into traveling formation, inner disciples at the center, outer disciples in protective positions, servants with the supply carts at the rear. Wei took his assigned position, adjusting the straps of the heaviest supply pack across his shoulders. The weight was substantial, designed to test the limits of a servant disciple's endurance, but he had spent years building his physical strength precisely because he lacked the spiritual energy that other disciples could use to lighten their burdens.

Jian Rou raised her hand, and the formation began moving toward the mountain path that would take them down to the valley below. From there, they would travel east for three days before reaching the boundaries of the Shattered Wastes.

As they passed through Azure Peaks' main gate, Wei allowed himself one backward glance at the sect that had been his home for eight years. The elegant buildings with their sweeping roofs, the training fields where he had never been permitted to practice, the gardens where he had worked countless hours in silent service—all receding as the expedition began its descent.

He felt no nostalgia, no sense of departure. Azure Peaks had never truly been home, merely the place where he had prepared for this moment. Whatever awaited in the Shattered Wastes—revelation or death—it would be preferable to the invisible existence he was leaving behind.

---

The journey to the Wastes' boundary took precisely the three days Elder Feng had estimated. The expedition maintained good pace, stopping only for brief meals and shorter rest periods than originally scheduled. Jian Rou's leadership style emphasized efficiency over comfort, a approach that the inner and outer disciples accepted without complaint. Only among the servant disciples were there occasional murmurs about the grueling pace, though never within earshot of their superiors.

Wei remained silent throughout, conserving energy and observing the changing landscape as they traveled eastward. The fertile valleys surrounding Azure Peaks gradually gave way to sparser vegetation and increasingly irregular terrain—early signs of the cataclysm's lingering effects. By the third day, the expedition was traversing a region where spiritual energy flowed in visibly distorted patterns, causing the more sensitive disciples to adjust their cultivation techniques to compensate.

They made camp at dusk on the third day, establishing position at the last relatively stable location before the official boundary of the Shattered Wastes. From their elevated position on a rocky plateau, the Wastes were visible in the near distance—a twisted landscape where reality itself seemed to waver, like heat rising from sun-baked stone.

"We enter the Wastes at dawn," Jian announced as the disciples gathered for the evening meal. "From that point forward, full defensive formations will be maintained at all times. Spiritual communication may become unreliable, so we will use the signal flags for coordination."

She unrolled a map on a flat stone at the center of their camp. The parchment displayed the known regions of the Wastes, though large areas remained blank or marked with warning symbols.

"Our primary target is here," she continued, indicating a location approximately two days' journey into the Wastes. "Previous expeditions identified ruins of what might have been a significant sect compound from the Forgotten Age. We'll establish base camp here—" she pointed to a location marked as having relatively stable spiritual energy "—and conduct focused exploration from that position."

The inner disciples nodded in understanding, while the outer disciples studied the map with varying degrees of confidence. The servant disciples, Wei included, were positioned at the edge of the gathering, expected to listen but not participate in the planning.

"Questions?" Jian asked, looking only at the inner and outer disciples.

One of the outer disciples, a young woman specializing in artifact identification, raised her hand. "Senior Sister, the reports mentioned Order activity in the eastern quadrant. Will we be avoiding that region entirely?"

Jian's expression tightened slightly. "Our expedition authorization permits us to explore any non-restricted areas of the Wastes. If we encounter Order representatives, we will show appropriate respect but proceed with our sect-approved objectives."

The answer satisfied the outer disciples, though Wei noted the subtle exchange of glances among the inner disciples. There was clearly some tension regarding the Order's presence that wasn't being openly discussed.

"Establish the night watch rotation," Jian instructed one of the other inner disciples. "Double sentries, with at least one inner disciple at all times. The boundary regions sometimes attract void-touched wildlife."

As the gathering dispersed, Wei moved to his assigned tasks—preparing the evening meal for the servant disciples and setting up the protective talismans around the supply carts. These routine duties provided cover as he carefully observed the inner disciples, who had moved to the edge of camp for a private conversation.

Their voices were too low to overhear directly, but Wei had spent years developing techniques to compensate for his lack of spiritual abilities. He adjusted his breathing and posture in a way that appeared natural while allowing him to focus his hearing with unusual precision—a skill born from necessity rather than cultivation.

"—not what the Sect Leader told us," one of the inner disciples was saying, his back to the main camp. "The Order specifically requested we avoid the central ruins."

"Which is precisely why we should investigate them," Jian replied, her voice carrying the faintest edge of defiance. "Azure Peaks doesn't answer to the Order in all matters. If there are artifacts of significance there, our sect has as much right to them as anyone."

"The Order doesn't make requests without reason," another inner disciple cautioned. "Whatever they're concerned about—"

"Is likely valuable," Jian interrupted. "The Order has always hoarded the most powerful artifacts from the Forgotten Age. This expedition is our opportunity to acquire something of true significance for Azure Peaks."

The conversation shifted to tactical matters—how to approach the ruins, what formations to use, contingency plans if they encountered resistance. Wei continued his tasks, processing this new information carefully. Jian's ambition was clearly driving the expedition toward greater risk than officially sanctioned, creating potential opportunities he could exploit.

As night fell fully over the camp, Wei completed his duties and retired to the small tent assigned to him and two other servant disciples. His tent-mates were already asleep, exhausted from the day's journey. Wei sat in meditation posture, not to cultivate—impossible without spiritual roots—but to organize his thoughts and prepare for what lay ahead.

Tomorrow they would enter the Shattered Wastes. Whatever knowledge he sought about alternative cultivation paths would be found there, if it existed at all. Eight years of preparation, of invisible existence, of absorbing every fragment of information he could access while being seen as nothing—all culminating in the opportunity that began with the dawn.

Wei opened his eyes, gazing through the tent opening at the distorted landscape visible in the distance. For a moment, he thought he saw patterns in the twisted terrain—structures that made a strange kind of sense if viewed from the right perspective. Then the moment passed, and the Wastes returned to their chaotic appearance.

He lay down on his thin sleeping mat, but his eyes remained open long into the night, fixed on the boundary they would cross when morning came.

---

Dawn arrived with unsettling abruptness in the boundary region. One moment the camp was shrouded in pre-dawn darkness; the next, light flooded across the plateau with unnatural intensity, as if the sun had appeared instantly rather than rising gradually. Several disciples startled awake, their cultivation-enhanced senses disturbed by the phenomenon.

"First boundary effect," Jian announced, already fully dressed and equipped. "The transition between night and day doesn't follow normal patterns here. Form up within the hour."

The expedition prepared with practiced efficiency, though Wei noticed increased tension in everyone's movements. Even the inner disciples, with their years of training and combat experience, showed subtle signs of apprehension as they checked and rechecked their spiritual weapons and defensive talismans.

Wei completed his preparations quickly, having packed most of his equipment before sleeping. As he secured the supply cart he was assigned to manage, one of the other servant disciples approached—Liu Min, a quiet young man who had joined the sect only two years ago.

"Is it true what they say?" Liu Min asked in a low voice. "That some who enter the Wastes never return to their original selves, even if their bodies make it back?"

Wei continued his work, neither slowing nor showing particular interest in the question. "The Wastes affect different people differently," he replied neutrally. "Those with unstable cultivation foundations are at greater risk."

"And those with no cultivation?" Liu Min pressed, unconsciously touching the jade token at his belt that marked him as rootless—born without spiritual aptitude, capable of serving cultivation sects but never joining their ranks as true disciples.

Wei glanced at him briefly. "We're already invisible," he said, his voice devoid of self-pity or bitterness, simply stating fact. "Perhaps we have less to lose."

Before Liu Min could respond, the signal came to form up. The expedition arranged itself in traveling formation, with additional defensive measures now in place. Inner disciples had activated their spiritual weapons, keeping them in ready position. Outer disciples had deployed sensory formations designed to provide early warning of danger. Servant disciples checked the protective talismans on the supply carts one final time.

Jian Rou stood at the formation's head, Azure Fang now unsheathed, its blade emitting a subtle blue glow. "We cross the boundary and enter the Shattered Wastes," she announced. "From this point forward, maintain spiritual vigilance at all times. Reality itself is unstable here. Trust your training and follow commands immediately."

She turned and began walking toward the visible distortion that marked the Wastes' boundary. The formation followed in precise order, each disciple maintaining their assigned position. As they approached the boundary, the air seemed to thicken, creating momentary resistance before yielding with an almost audible snap.

Wei felt the transition as a sudden pressure change that made his ears pop, followed by a wave of disorientation that passed quickly. Around him, disciples with active cultivation cores reacted more strongly—several staggering briefly before regaining composure, others wincing as their spiritual energy fluctuated in response to the altered environment.

Once across the boundary, the landscape changed dramatically. What had appeared as distant distortion now surrounded them completely. The ground beneath their feet remained solid, but its composition shifted unpredictably—stone giving way to crystalline structures, then to something resembling petrified wood, then back to stone of a completely different type.

The sky above had taken on a faintly iridescent quality, like oil on water, occasionally rippling with patterns that suggested something moving beyond the visible spectrum. The air itself carried unfamiliar scents—metallic one moment, floral the next, then something entirely unidentifiable.

"Standard formation, reduced pace," Jian ordered, her voice cutting through the disciples' distraction. "First objective is reaching the stable zone for base camp. We have approximately six hours of travel before the first major void fracture zone."

The expedition moved forward into the Wastes, adjusting to the strange environment with varying degrees of success. Wei found that his lack of spiritual perception actually provided a certain advantage—he experienced the physical strangeness of the Wastes but was spared the spiritual dissonance that clearly affected the cultivators around him.

As they progressed deeper into the altered landscape, Wei observed the environment with careful attention. The Wastes were not merely damaged land but a place where reality followed different rules. Gravity occasionally fluctuated, causing loose objects to drift momentarily before returning to normal behavior. Light sometimes bent around certain formations, creating illusions of distance and shape. Spiritual energy flowed in patterns that contradicted all conventional cultivation theory, pooling in locations that should have repelled it and avoiding areas that should have attracted it.

By midday, they had covered less ground than planned but had avoided any serious incidents. The formation paused at what appeared to be a relatively stable location—a flat expanse of crystallized earth surrounded by twisted formations that might once have been trees.

"Rest and recovery," Jian announced. "Fifteen minutes only. Maintain defensive awareness."

The disciples broke formation with visible relief, though none strayed far from their assigned groups. Wei used the opportunity to scan the horizon, noting landmarks and comparing them to what he had memorized from the expedition maps. They were proceeding slightly north of the planned route, perhaps due to Jian's desire to approach the central ruins from an unexpected direction.

As he surveyed their surroundings, Wei noticed something unusual about one of the crystallized formations approximately fifty paces from their position. Unlike the others, which reflected light in random patterns, this formation seemed to absorb light in a way that created a subtle void-like appearance. The effect was barely perceptible—not something that would attract attention unless specifically observed.

Wei glanced toward the inner disciples, confirming they were occupied with their own discussions. He adjusted his position casually, moving to secure a supply pack that had shifted during travel, using the movement to approach the unusual formation without appearing to target it specifically.

As he drew closer, the formation's strange properties became more evident. It wasn't merely absorbing light but seemed to exist in slight misalignment with its surroundings, as if occupying the same space but not quite the same reality. Wei had read accounts of such phenomena in the limited texts he had accessed about the Wastes—descriptions of "reality anchors" where objects from the Forgotten Age had partially merged with the altered post-cataclysm environment.

He was about to move closer when a sharp command cut through the air.

"All disciples, defensive positions! Void fluctuation approaching from the east!"

Wei immediately returned to his assigned position, all disciples moving with practiced urgency into a protective formation. In the distance, a visible distortion approached—a rippling in the air that bent light around it, creating a lens-like effect that magnified and distorted whatever lay beyond.

"Stationary defense," Jian ordered, Azure Fang raised before her. "Outer disciples, establish the Sixfold Warding Formation. Inner disciples, prepare counter-resonance techniques."

The void fluctuation advanced steadily toward their position, its effects becoming more pronounced as it approached. The crystallized ground beneath their feet began to vibrate subtly, emitting a faint ringing sound that gradually increased in pitch and volume.

Wei watched with outward calm as the cultivators around him activated defensive techniques. The outer disciples had formed a hexagonal pattern, each channeling spiritual energy into a formation designed to stabilize reality against void intrusions. The inner disciples stood at ready positions, their spiritual weapons glowing with accumulated power.

The fluctuation halted approximately thirty paces from their formation, hovering like a heat mirage. For several tense moments, nothing happened—the distortion simply remained in place, rippling occasionally but making no further advance.

Then, without warning, it collapsed inward, shrinking from the size of a small building to a point no larger than a clenched fist. The air around it seemed to inhale, drawing dust and small debris toward the concentrated distortion.

"Implosion imminent," one of the inner disciples warned. "Brace for—"

The void point exploded outward, releasing a wave of distortion that passed through the expedition's formation like a sudden gust of wind. The defensive formations held, preventing any direct damage, but the spiritual backlash was immediately evident. Several outer disciples staggered, their faces paling as their cultivation cores struggled to maintain stability. Even the inner disciples showed signs of strain, their spiritual energy fluctuating visibly around their weapons.

Wei, lacking a cultivation core to be disrupted, experienced the event differently—a momentary sensation of existing in multiple places simultaneously, followed by a sharp return to singular presence that left him slightly disoriented but otherwise unaffected.

As the distortion dissipated, Jian lowered Azure Fang, its glow dimming as she reduced her spiritual output. "Status report," she commanded.

The disciples reported in sequence—no serious injuries, though three outer disciples would need time to restabilize their cultivation cores, and one servant disciple had fainted from the sensory overload. The supplies remained secure, protected by the talismans that had been specifically designed for Wastes expeditions.

"A relatively minor fluctuation," Jian assessed, though her expression suggested she was less confident than her words implied. "We'll adjust our route slightly north to avoid the affected area. The fluctuation cycle typically creates a pattern of aftershocks that we should evade."

As the formation reorganized for continued travel, Wei cast one final glance toward the unusual crystallized formation he had noticed earlier. The void fluctuation had changed it—where before it had merely absorbed light in an unusual way, now it emitted a faint luminescence that pulsed with a steady rhythm, like a heartbeat.

Wei committed its location to memory. Something about that formation resonated with the dream that had haunted him before the expedition—the image of a crystal sphere arcing through a fractured sky. If opportunity arose to separate from the main group, that formation would be worth investigating.

For now, he returned to his position with the supply carts, maintaining his role as the invisible servant while the expedition continued deeper into the Shattered Wastes. The first day had already demonstrated the unpredictable nature of this twisted landscape. What awaited them at the central ruins—their official target and Jian's personal objective—remained to be seen.

Wei adjusted the heavy pack on his shoulders and followed the formation forward, his outward compliance masking the separate path he intended to forge when the moment was right.
