# Chapter 4: First Contact

Night fell differently in the Shattered Wastes. 

Unlike the abrupt dawn they had experienced, darkness crept in from multiple directions simultaneously, as if seeping through cracks in reality rather than following the sun's natural retreat. The expedition had established their first camp in what Jian Rou identified as a relatively stable pocket—a small plateau where crystallized formations created a natural barrier against the more volatile elements of the Wastes.

Wei Liang worked methodically to secure the supply carts, applying additional layers of protective talismans as instructed. Around him, the other disciples established the camp's defensive perimeter with practiced efficiency. Inner disciples positioned themselves at cardinal points, maintaining a low-level spiritual resonance that helped stabilize the immediate area. Outer disciples established monitoring formations designed to provide early warning of approaching void fluctuations or other dangers.

"Servant Wei," called one of the outer disciples—a young woman named Mei Lin who specialized in artifact identification. "Bring the sensing equipment to the eastern perimeter."

Wei gathered the requested items—delicate instruments designed to measure spiritual energy fluctuations, carefully packed in reinforced cases—and carried them to where Mei Lin waited. Unlike most disciples, she acknowledged his presence with a brief nod as he arranged the equipment beside her.

"The readings are unusual," she said, not directly addressing Wei but speaking aloud as she activated the primary sensing array. "The spiritual currents here don't follow any pattern I recognize from the texts."

Wei maintained a properly deferential posture but observed the readings with careful attention. The crystalline display showed energy flowing in spiral patterns rather than the linear or cyclical movements typical of normal environments. More interesting was the occasional inversion—points where the energy briefly flowed backward before resuming its spiral pattern.

"Almost like breathing," Wei murmured, the observation slipping out before he could contain it.

Mei Lin glanced at him with surprise, then back at the display. "Yes," she said after a moment, "that's an apt description." She studied him with new interest. "You've had training in spiritual energy pattern recognition?"

"This one has only observed while serving in the sect library," Wei replied, the practiced humility masking his extensive self-education. "Senior Sister's instruments show patterns similar to ancient texts this one helped archive."

Before Mei Lin could inquire further, Jian Rou approached, her expression sharp with disapproval. "Outer Disciple Mei, why are you discussing expedition findings with a servant?"

Mei Lin straightened immediately. "Senior Sister, I was merely—"

"Complete your readings in silence," Jian interrupted. "Servant, return to your assigned duties."

Wei bowed and retreated without protest, though he had already committed the unusual energy patterns to memory. As he returned to the supply area, he noted that the camp had been established with a subtle modification to the standard expedition protocol—the formation was oriented slightly northwest rather than true north, creating an alignment with what appeared to be distant ruins visible on the horizon.

The central ruins—their official destination—lay in a different direction entirely. This confirmed Wei's earlier suspicion that Jian had alternative objectives beyond those sanctioned by the sect.

As night deepened over the camp, the Wastes revealed new peculiarities. Bioluminescent growth appeared on some of the crystallized formations surrounding their position, emitting a pale blue light that pulsed in irregular patterns. The sky above displayed no recognizable stars but instead showed shifting constellations that appeared to move independently of any celestial logic.

Wei completed his assigned evening tasks and retreated to the small tent he shared with Liu Min and another servant disciple. His tent-mates were already asleep, exhausted by the day's journey and the strange spiritual pressure of the Wastes. Wei sat in meditation posture, using the quiet hours to plan his next moves.

The unusual formation he had observed earlier—the one that had changed after the void fluctuation—remained fixed in his thoughts. Its location was approximately two hours' travel from their current position, assuming he could move undetected during the night. The expedition's attention would be focused on the northwest ruins that had caught Jian's interest, potentially creating an opportunity for him to investigate separately.

The risk was substantial. Traveling alone in the Wastes violated every protocol established for expeditions. If caught, he would face severe punishment upon return to the sect. If something went wrong, death was the most likely outcome—and not necessarily a quick or simple death, given the Wastes' unpredictable nature.

Yet the alternative—returning to Azure Peaks without discovering what he sought—was no alternative at all. Eight years of invisible existence, of careful preparation and patient endurance, had been invested in this single opportunity.

Wei's meditation was interrupted by voices outside—hushed but intense, coming from near the inner disciples' tents. He adjusted his position slightly, employing the focused hearing technique he had developed over years of eavesdropping on sect discussions.

"—can't divert the entire expedition," one voice was saying—Disciple Chen, Jian's closest ally among the inner disciples. "The others will question."

"We don't need the entire expedition," Jian replied, her tone carrying the edge of someone unaccustomed to having decisions questioned. "You and I can investigate the northwest site while the main group continues toward the central ruins. We'll rejoin them before they realize our true purpose."

"And if we encounter whatever has drawn the Order's attention?" Chen asked.

"Then we'll have found exactly what we're looking for," Jian said with quiet intensity. "Something valuable enough that the Order wishes to keep it from the sects."

Their voices faded as they moved away from Wei's position, but he had heard enough. Jian planned to split from the main expedition tomorrow, creating precisely the diversion he needed for his own separate investigation. The coincidence seemed almost too perfect—as if the Wastes themselves were arranging circumstances to suit his purpose.

Wei allowed himself a small, rare smile in the darkness of the tent. Tomorrow would bring opportunity, and with it, risk. He would need to be prepared for both.

---

Dawn arrived more gradually than the previous day, the light seeping into the Wastes through what appeared to be cracks in the fabric of reality itself. Wei was already awake and completing his morning duties when Jian called the expedition to assembly.

"We've detected unusual spiritual readings from two separate locations," she announced, indicating points on the map spread before them. "The northwest site shows signs of active spiritual formations that may be Forgotten Age artifacts. The central ruins remain our primary objective as planned."

She paused, surveying the gathered disciples with an expression of calculated consideration. "To maximize our expedition's efficiency, we will divide into two groups. Inner Disciple Chen and I will investigate the northwest site with a small team. The main expedition will continue toward the central ruins under Inner Disciple Feng's leadership."

The announcement created a ripple of surprise among the disciples. Splitting an expedition in the Wastes violated standard protocols, a fact that several outer disciples seemed about to point out before thinking better of challenging Jian directly.

"We will rejoin the main group at the central ruins by sunset tomorrow," Jian continued. "Outer Disciples Mei, Zhao, and Liu will accompany us. The remaining disciples will proceed with Inner Disciple Feng."

She assigned two servant disciples to her smaller team—neither of them Wei, who was instructed to remain with the main expedition. This suited his plans perfectly, as it would be easier to separate from the larger group during their journey.

The expedition divided its supplies and established communication protocols using signal talismans that would allow the two groups to alert each other in emergencies. By mid-morning, they were ready to depart in their separate directions.

Wei watched as Jian's smaller team headed northwest toward the distant ruins that had caught her interest. Once they were out of sight, Inner Disciple Feng organized the remaining expedition members into a modified traveling formation.

"We proceed to the central ruins as planned," Feng announced, his manner more methodical and less imperious than Jian's. "Standard defensive protocols remain in effect. We will establish base camp at the designated location by nightfall."

The reduced expedition began moving eastward toward their original objective. Wei maintained his position with the supply carts, observing as the landscape grew increasingly distorted around them. The crystallized formations became more elaborate and widespread, creating structures that resembled frozen waves or shattered cathedral spires. The ground beneath their feet occasionally shifted in composition, transitioning from stone to crystal to something with the texture of petrified wood.

As they progressed deeper into the Wastes, Wei carefully monitored their position relative to the unusual formation he had observed the previous day. By midday, when the expedition paused for a brief rest, they were less than half an hour's travel from its location.

Wei used the rest period to prepare. He adjusted his pack, ensuring it contained the minimal supplies he would need if separated from the group—water, basic rations, a small medical kit, and the few protective talismans he had managed to acquire through careful trading with other servant disciples. None of these preparations were visible to casual observation; years of living invisibly had taught him how to hide his true activities in plain sight.

The opportunity came sooner than expected. As the expedition prepared to resume travel, a void fluctuation appeared in the distance—similar to the one they had encountered the previous day but larger and moving in an erratic pattern that suggested greater instability.

"Defensive positions," Inner Disciple Feng ordered. "Prepare for possible evasive maneuvers."

The disciples moved into formation, attention focused on the approaching distortion. Wei, positioned at the rear with the supply carts, used the moment of collective distraction to implement his plan. He secured his assigned cart with a final knot, then simply stepped away, moving behind a large crystallized formation that blocked line of sight from the main group.

No one called out. No one noticed his absence. The expedition's attention remained fixed on the void fluctuation that approached from the opposite direction.

Wei moved quickly but carefully, using the crystallized formations for cover as he put distance between himself and the expedition. The unusual formation he sought lay to the south of their position—a direction neither group was traveling, making detection less likely.

As he navigated the twisted landscape, Wei maintained awareness of his surroundings with the heightened perception he had developed to compensate for his lack of spiritual senses. The Wastes were not silent—they produced a constant background of sounds unlike anything in the normal world. Crystalline structures occasionally emitted tones that seemed to respond to proximity. The air itself sometimes carried whispers that formed no recognizable words but nonetheless conveyed impressions of meaning.

After approximately twenty minutes of careful travel, Wei spotted his objective—the formation that had absorbed light before the void fluctuation and emitted luminescence after. In daylight, its properties were even more unusual. The crystallized structure, approximately the size of a small shrine, seemed to exist slightly out of alignment with its surroundings, as if occupying the same space but not quite the same reality.

Wei approached cautiously, circling the formation to observe it from all angles before drawing closer. The luminescence he had noticed previously was still present but subdued in daylight—a faint pulsing glow that originated from deep within the crystalline structure rather than its surface.

He reached into his pack and removed a small jade token—one of the few possessions he had brought from Azure Peaks. The token was unremarkable, a simple identification marker given to all servant disciples, but Wei had modified it slightly over the years, etching tiny formations into its surface that were based on fragments of texts he had studied in the sect library.

These modifications were crude approximations of spiritual techniques he couldn't perform directly without cultivation ability, but they allowed the token to function as a basic sensing tool. He held it toward the crystallized formation, watching as the jade responded—growing warmer and emitting a faint resonance that matched the pulsing luminescence.

"A response," Wei murmured to himself. "Something within recognizes the formation patterns."

Encouraged by this reaction, he moved closer to the crystallized structure, examining its surface for any markings or indications of purpose. The material appeared seamless at first glance, but as he studied it more carefully, Wei detected subtle patterns embedded within—geometric formations that created three-dimensional structures when viewed from certain angles.

He recognized elements of these patterns from the forbidden texts he had glimpsed during his years serving in the sect library—fragments of Forgotten Age cultivation theory that had been preserved despite the Order's efforts to eliminate all records from before the cataclysm.

Wei circled the formation once more, this time trailing his fingers lightly across its surface. The crystal felt neither warm nor cold but seemed to respond to his touch with subtle vibrations that traveled up his arm and resonated in his chest.

When he completed the circuit and returned to his starting point, Wei noticed something had changed. A small section of the crystal had shifted, revealing what appeared to be a recessed area approximately the size of his palm. Within this recess, something glinted—an object embedded in the crystal but distinct from it.

Wei hesitated, aware that he was crossing a threshold beyond which retreat might be impossible. Everything in his limited training warned against direct interaction with unknown artifacts in the Wastes. Yet this was precisely what he had come to find—something outside the boundaries of conventional cultivation wisdom.

He reached toward the recess, his fingers hovering just above the embedded object. The luminescence within the crystal pulsed more rapidly, as if responding to his proximity. The jade token in his other hand grew warmer, its resonance intensifying.

"What was forgotten," Wei whispered, recalling a fragment from one of the prohibited texts, "waits to be remembered."

He pressed his palm against the recess.

The crystal flared with sudden brilliance, light pouring from within and enveloping Wei in a cocoon of luminescence. He felt no pain, only a strange sensation of suspension—as if he had stepped outside the normal flow of time. The light pulsed around him in patterns that matched the geometric formations he had observed within the crystal.

Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the light receded, drawing back into the crystal formation. Wei remained standing, physically unchanged but aware of something new within his consciousness—a presence that hadn't been there before.

"Empty enough," said a voice that seemed to originate from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. "A vessel without cultivation. Perfect."

Wei turned, searching for the source of the voice, but saw only the twisted landscape of the Wastes surrounding him. "Who speaks?" he asked, his voice steady despite the strangeness of the situation.

"I am Sutra," the voice replied. "Or what remains of what was once called Sutra. A guide-aspect of the Forgotten Path, preserved against the cataclysm."

Wei's heart raced despite his outward calm. The Forgotten Path—a term he had encountered only in the most heavily restricted texts, always with warnings of heresy and destruction. An alternative approach to cultivation that had been systematically erased from official records after the cataclysm.

"You sought knowledge beyond conventional cultivation," the voice continued. "You came to the Wastes pursuing what others fear to remember. This is why you were found suitable."

"Suitable for what?" Wei asked.

"To walk the Forgotten Path," Sutra answered. "To become a vessel for what was deliberately erased. To remember what the cultivation world chose to forget."

The crystallized formation before Wei had changed again—the recess now empty, whatever had been embedded there apparently transferred to him in some non-physical manner. The luminescence remained but had stabilized into a steady glow rather than a pulsing rhythm.

"I have no spiritual roots," Wei said, stating the fundamental limitation that had defined his existence. "Cultivation is impossible for me."

"Conventional cultivation requires spiritual roots," Sutra acknowledged. "The Forgotten Path does not. It operates by inverse principles—not accumulation but consumption. Not building but unmaking. Not filling but emptying."

Wei considered this, connecting it to fragments he had pieced together from prohibited texts. "The Inverse Meridian Theory," he said. "Cultivation through reversal of standard energy flows."

"You have studied well for one denied access to true knowledge," Sutra observed, a note of approval in its disembodied voice. "Yes, the Inverse Meridian Theory forms the foundation of the Forgotten Path. What conventional cultivation rejects, we embrace. What it fills, we empty. What it builds, we unmake."

"And this allows those without spiritual roots to cultivate?" Wei asked, unable to fully suppress the hope in his voice.

"Not merely allows," Sutra corrected. "Prefers. Those born with spiritual roots are already filled with potential in conventional terms. They must be emptied before they can begin the Forgotten Path—a painful and difficult process. You, born empty by conventional standards, can begin immediately."

Wei absorbed this information, connecting it with his years of secret study and preparation. If true, it represented everything he had hoped to find in the Wastes—a path forward that transformed his greatest limitation into an advantage.

"How do I begin?" he asked.

"You already have," Sutra replied. "The initial connection has been established. I will guide you through the first inversions when you are ready to proceed."

Wei glanced back in the direction of the expedition, aware that his absence would eventually be noticed. "I cannot remain separated from my group indefinitely," he said. "They will search for me once they realize I'm missing."

"Return to them," Sutra advised. "Maintain your external role while beginning the internal work. The early stages of the Forgotten Path require no visible manifestations that would betray your activities."

"And you?" Wei asked. "Will you remain here, in this formation?"

"I am now connected to your consciousness," Sutra explained. "Where you go, I will go. The physical anchor was merely a preservation mechanism, no longer needed now that a suitable vessel has been found."

Wei nodded, processing this new reality. He had come to the Wastes seeking knowledge and had found something far more significant—a guide to a forbidden cultivation path that might transform him from powerless servant to something entirely different.

"I will return to the expedition," he decided. "And begin learning what you can teach."

"Wise," Sutra approved. "Patience serves the Forgotten Path. What conventional cultivation achieves through force and accumulation, we accomplish through subtlety and inversion."

Wei gathered his pack and oriented himself toward the expedition's last position. Before departing, he looked back at the crystallized formation one final time. Its luminescence had dimmed significantly, the pulsing glow now barely visible in daylight.

"What was this place?" he asked. "Before the cataclysm?"

"A preservation vault," Sutra answered. "One of many established by those who foresaw the coming instability. Most were destroyed in the cataclysm or found and purged by the Order afterward. This one remained hidden, waiting for someone empty enough to receive what was forgotten."

Wei committed the location to memory, then began making his way back toward the expedition. He moved carefully but with greater confidence than before, aware that his return needed to appear natural—as if he had merely become separated temporarily rather than deliberately strayed.

As he traveled, he became aware of Sutra's presence in his consciousness—not intrusive but distinct, like a new perspective that offered alternative interpretations of everything he observed. The Wastes themselves appeared different through this expanded awareness, their seemingly chaotic patterns revealing subtle structures that conventional perception missed entirely.

"The Wastes are not broken," Sutra commented, responding to Wei's observations. "They are merely operating according to different principles than the stabilized world beyond. Here, reality remains fluid, responsive to intention rather than fixed in form."

Wei considered this as he navigated the crystallized landscape. "Is this why the Order restricts access to the Wastes? Because they reveal alternatives to the principles they enforce?"

"Precisely," Sutra confirmed. "The Order of Sixfold Balance emerged after the cataclysm with a single purpose—to establish and maintain a specific interpretation of cultivation principles. Alternative approaches threatened their authority and were systematically eliminated."

This aligned with the fragments Wei had pieced together from prohibited texts—hints of a more diverse cultivation world before the cataclysm, with multiple valid paths rather than the rigid hierarchy that now prevailed.

As he approached the expedition's last known position, Wei heard voices calling his name—search parties sent to locate the missing servant disciple. He adjusted his appearance quickly, creating signs of distress and disorientation that would support his planned explanation.

"Remember," Sutra advised as Wei prepared to reveal himself, "you must remain invisible in their eyes while beginning to see what they cannot."

Wei nodded slightly, then stumbled into view of the nearest search party, his expression carefully crafted to show relief and lingering fear.

"Servant Wei!" called one of the outer disciples. "Where have you been? The expedition has been searching for nearly an hour."

Wei bowed deeply, assuming the proper posture of a servant disciple addressing superiors. "This one became disoriented during the void fluctuation," he explained, his voice appropriately humble. "When the formation moved to avoid the distortion, this one followed what appeared to be the group but was actually a void mirage."

The explanation was plausible—void mirages were a documented phenomenon in the Wastes, creating illusions that could separate unwary travelers from their groups. The outer disciples exchanged glances, then nodded in reluctant acceptance.

"You're fortunate to have survived," one said. "Come, Inner Disciple Feng is waiting. The expedition has established temporary camp while searching for you."

Wei followed obediently, maintaining his role as the humble servant while internally processing the profound change in his circumstances. Within his consciousness, Sutra remained present but silent, observing as Wei reintegrated with the expedition.

Inner Disciple Feng was predictably displeased, subjecting Wei to a stern reprimand about maintaining formation discipline and the dangers of separation in the Wastes. Wei accepted the criticism with appropriate deference, promising greater vigilance in the future.

"You will be restricted to central position in the formation for the remainder of the expedition," Feng concluded. "No independent movement, even within camp perimeters."

"This one understands and accepts discipline," Wei replied, bowing deeply.

The punishment was inconvenient but not unexpected. More importantly, it did nothing to hinder the internal process that had already begun—the first steps on the Forgotten Path that Sutra would guide him through.

As the expedition resumed its journey toward the central ruins, Wei maintained his assigned position, outwardly the same servant disciple who had departed Azure Peaks three days earlier. Inwardly, everything had changed. Where once there had been only frustrated ambition and careful observation, now there was connection to knowledge long suppressed and the beginning of a path that inverted everything he had been taught about cultivation.

"The first inversion begins with breath," Sutra instructed as Wei walked with the formation. "Not drawing energy in, as conventional cultivation teaches, but pushing emptiness out. Not filling meridians but hollowing them."

Wei adjusted his breathing subtly, following Sutra's guidance while maintaining an outward appearance of normalcy. The technique felt strange—counterintuitive to everything he had observed of conventional cultivation practices—yet somehow natural to his body, as if he were finally moving with rather than against his nature.

"Yes," Sutra approved. "You learn quickly. The Hollow Awakening has begun."

Around him, the expedition continued toward the central ruins, disciples maintaining formation and discussing their observations of the Wastes. None noticed the servant disciple in their midst had begun a journey that would eventually transform him into something the cultivation world had spent centuries trying to forget.

Wei Liang, invisible by design and empty by birth, had found his path. What that path would make of him—and what he would unmake through it—remained to be seen.
