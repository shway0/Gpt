# Chapter 16: Memory as Currency

The convergence point glowed with a soft violet light as Wei Liang completed the final stabilization of his Fractured Core. Unlike his previous attempt that had been interrupted by Void Hunters, this time he'd found a smaller, more secluded convergence hidden deep within a collapsed temple complex. The ancient structure's remaining walls provided both cover and a natural amplification of the void energies he needed.

As the last of the stabilization energy flowed through his meridians, Wei exhaled slowly, feeling the fractures in his core settle into a controlled pattern—not healed, but organized into channels that could direct energy rather than leak it.

*Stabilization complete at seventy-eight percent efficiency,* Sutra confirmed. *Core structure will maintain integrity under standard conditions.*

Wei opened his eyes, taking in the ruined temple around him. Fragments of statues lay scattered across the floor, their features worn smooth by centuries of exposure to the Wastes' corrosive atmosphere. Only one remained partially intact—a seated figure with six arms, each hand forming a different cultivation seal.

"Who did they worship here?" Wei wondered aloud, studying the statue.

*Not worship,* Sutra corrected. *This was a teaching temple from the Forgotten Age. The six-armed figure represents the Six Paths of Cultivation that existed before the Order's standardization.*

Wei approached the statue, running his fingers over the weathered stone. "Six paths? The Order only acknowledges one true path."

*The Order acknowledges what serves its authority,* Sutra replied. *History contains many inconvenient truths.*

A sudden wave of dizziness washed over Wei, forcing him to brace himself against the statue. The stabilization had taken more energy than he'd anticipated, leaving him drained and vulnerable.

*Your reserves are critically depleted,* Sutra observed. *Conventional recovery methods will require approximately seven days to restore functional capacity.*

"We don't have seven days," Wei muttered, thinking of the Bonebrand hunter he'd encountered. Word would spread about a void practitioner who could unravel cultivation. Both independent hunters and the Order would intensify their search.

*There is an alternative method,* Sutra suggested after a moment's hesitation. *The pendant's knowledge contains techniques for accelerated energy restoration.*

Wei withdrew the jade pendant Ru Yun had given him, focusing his perception through it. The shifting engravings resolved into text describing a cultivation technique unlike anything he'd encountered before—a method that used memory itself as a power source.

"This can't be right," Wei said, reading the technique again. "It says to sacrifice personal memories to fuel cultivation."

*Correct,* Sutra confirmed. *Memory contains concentrated spiritual essence—experiences imprinted on your core. By deliberately releasing those imprints, you convert them to usable energy.*

Wei frowned. "But I'd forget whatever memories I use?"

*Precisely. The technique requires choosing which memories to sacrifice—a literal exchange of past for power.*

The concept was disturbing yet fascinating. Conventional cultivation taught that memory was sacred, the accumulated wisdom that guided a practitioner's advancement. To deliberately discard memories as fuel seemed sacrilegious.

"What happens to the memories?" Wei asked. "Do they simply disappear?"

*They are converted to pure energy,* Sutra explained. *However, the technique describes an interesting phenomenon—memory fragments sometimes manifest in your surroundings or transfer to objects you frequently contact.*

Wei considered his options. Waiting seven days for natural recovery wasn't viable, but sacrificing his memories seemed like a dangerous bargain. Yet hadn't his entire journey since being abandoned in the Wastes been about embracing methods the Order condemned?

"Show me how," he decided.

Following Sutra's guidance, Wei seated himself in meditation posture before the six-armed statue. The technique required identifying specific memories to sacrifice—the more emotionally significant, the more energy they would yield.

"I'll start with something small," Wei said, searching through his recollections. He settled on a memory from his early training days—his first successful formation of a spirit blade. The pride he'd felt, the approving nod from his master, the sensation of energy flowing through perfectly aligned meridians.

*Focus on the memory completely,* Sutra instructed. *Bring every detail to the surface of your consciousness.*

Wei immersed himself in the recollection, rebuilding it piece by piece until it felt as vivid as the day it happened. He could feel the cool morning air, hear the distant sounds of other disciples training, see the sunlight reflecting off his newly formed spirit blade.

*Now invert your perception,* Sutra continued. *Instead of experiencing the memory, observe it as external to yourself.*

This was more difficult. Wei struggled to separate himself from the emotional content of the memory, to view it as an object rather than an experience. Gradually, he managed to create distance, until the memory seemed to hover before him like a scene viewed through glass.

*Apply void technique to create absence where the memory exists,* Sutra directed.

Wei extended his perception as he had when unraveling the Bonebrand hunter's cultivation, but this time he turned it inward. He created a small pocket of void—a space of deliberate absence—around the externalized memory.

The effect was immediate and startling. The memory began to unravel, its components breaking down into pure energy that flowed into Wei's depleted reserves. The sensation was both exhilarating and disturbing—power rushing through his meridians even as he felt the memory fading from his mind.

Within moments, it was gone. Wei searched his recollection but found only a vague impression that he had once formed a spirit blade for the first time. The details—the sensations, the emotions, the specific circumstances—had vanished completely.

"It worked," he said, surprised by the efficiency of the technique. His energy reserves had increased noticeably, though nowhere near full capacity.

*The energy yield correlates directly to the memory's emotional significance,* Sutra noted. *This was a relatively minor memory. Greater results would require sacrificing more significant experiences.*

Wei nodded, already considering which memory to sacrifice next. The technique was addictive in its immediacy—instant power in exchange for pieces of his past. He selected another memory, this one from his childhood—the first time he'd successfully climbed the thousand steps to the sect's mountain temple without stopping.

Again, he externalized the memory and applied the void technique. Again, energy flowed into his reserves as the memory dissolved. This time, he noticed something strange—as the memory faded from his mind, a faint image appeared briefly on the temple floor beside him: a child's footprint in stone dust.

"You said fragments sometimes manifest physically," Wei said, touching the footprint. It felt solid for a moment before dissolving into ash.

*The phenomenon is documented in the pendant's knowledge,* Sutra confirmed. *Memory essence sometimes creates temporary physical echoes before complete conversion to energy.*

Wei continued the process, sacrificing memory after memory. Each dissolution brought more energy and left behind brief manifestations—a flicker of candlelight, the scent of incense, the sound of distant chanting that faded almost immediately. His reserves filled steadily, the depleted void in his core gradually replenishing.

After sacrificing a dozen minor memories, Wei paused to assess his progress. His energy levels had reached approximately forty percent of capacity—a significant improvement, but still far from optimal.

*Continued progress will require more significant memories,* Sutra observed.

Wei hesitated. The memories he'd sacrificed so far had been relatively inconsequential—training exercises, routine days, minor achievements. What remained were more fundamental experiences: his acceptance into the sect, his first meeting with Master Feng, his advancement ceremonies.

"If I sacrifice too much, who will I be?" he wondered aloud.

*An inevitable question when using memory as currency,* Sutra replied. *The technique's original practitioners developed methods to preserve core identity while sacrificing peripheral experiences.*

"Show me," Wei said.

Sutra guided him through a modification of the technique—a method to identify and isolate core identity memories before beginning the sacrifice process. Wei carefully separated his fundamental self-conception from the experiences that had shaped it, creating a protected core of memories that defined who he was.

With these safeguards in place, he resumed the process, this time selecting more significant memories. He sacrificed his recollection of his first major cultivation breakthrough, the ceremony where he received his sect robes, his initial meeting with fellow disciples who later became rivals.

As these deeper memories dissolved, the physical manifestations became more pronounced. The temple floor briefly showed the pattern of a cultivation formation he had once mastered. The air shimmered with the colors of sect banners from an advancement ceremony. For a few seconds, he heard the clear voice of Master Feng giving instructions during a critical training session.

Each manifestation faded quickly, but Wei noticed something disturbing—they were lasting progressively longer. The technique was becoming more efficient with practice, but that efficiency had an unexpected consequence: the memory fragments were gaining substance before their final conversion to energy.

After sacrificing a particularly significant memory—the day he'd been selected for special training by Master Feng—Wei was startled to see a translucent figure form beside him. It resembled Master Feng, though distorted and incomplete, like a reflection in troubled water.

The apparition turned toward him, its features shifting and indistinct. "Potential... wasted..." it seemed to say, though the voice was more impression than sound. Then it dissolved, breaking apart into motes of light that flowed into Wei's core.

Wei scrambled backward, disturbed by the manifestation. "What was that?"

*Memory manifestation gaining coherence,* Sutra explained. *The technique's efficiency increases with use, allowing more complete externalization before energy conversion.*

"It spoke to me," Wei said, unsettled.

*Not precisely,* Sutra corrected. *You perceived speech because your mind interpreted the memory fragment in familiar terms. The manifestation has no independent consciousness.*

Despite this reassurance, Wei felt increasingly uneasy as he continued the process. His energy reserves had reached seventy percent capacity, but each sacrifice now produced more substantial manifestations. Fragments of conversations played out around him. Ghostly figures performed partial actions before dissolving. The temple seemed to flicker between its ruined present and glimpses of its intact past—not from Wei's memories, but from some deeper resonance the technique was activating.

After sacrificing the memory of his first solo mission for the sect, Wei reached for another significant recollection—and found a disturbing gap. He couldn't remember the name of his home village.

"Something's wrong," he said, a note of panic in his voice. "I'm losing memories I didn't sacrifice."

*Technique side effect,* Sutra acknowledged. *Memory boundaries become permeable with repeated use. Adjacent memories sometimes experience degradation.*

Wei tried to recall his parents' faces and found only blurred impressions. He could remember having a childhood friend, but not their name or what they looked like. Fragments of his identity were eroding despite his precautions.

"We need to stop," Wei decided, rising unsteadily to his feet. His energy reserves had reached eighty-five percent—not full, but substantial enough for safety.

As he stood, a wave of disorientation washed over him. The temple seemed to shift around him, walls rebuilding themselves before crumbling again, statues rising from fragments only to dissolve back into rubble. Reality itself felt thin, as if the boundary between memory and present had worn away.

*Memory conversion has temporarily destabilized local reality,* Sutra observed. *Effect should dissipate within hours.*

Wei stumbled toward the temple entrance, desperate for fresh air and solid reality. Outside, the perpetual twilight of the Wastes was a relief after the shifting unreality within. He leaned against a broken column, trying to center himself.

"Who am I?" he whispered, suddenly uncertain. He knew his name was Wei Liang, knew he had been a disciple abandoned in the Wastes, knew he was developing inverse cultivation under Sutra's guidance. But the connective tissue of his life—the experiences that linked these facts into a coherent narrative—had grown thin and fragmented.

*Your core identity remains intact,* Sutra assured him. *Peripheral memory loss is temporary. Some will regenerate naturally.*

"And the rest?" Wei asked.

*Permanently converted to energy,* Sutra confirmed. *The exchange is irreversible.*

Wei looked back at the temple, where ghostly afterimages of his sacrificed memories still flickered faintly among the ruins. The technique had given him the energy he needed, but at what cost? Parts of himself were now literally powering his cultivation, transformed from experience into raw spiritual force.

"We use this method only when absolutely necessary," Wei decided, pushing away from the column. "The price is too high for routine application."

*Agreed,* Sutra replied. *Though you should note that the pendant describes advanced practitioners who developed methods to selectively sacrifice memories with precision, minimizing identity erosion.*

Wei touched the jade pendant, its engravings shifting beneath his fingers. "Did Lin Mei use this technique?"

*The pendant suggests she developed it,* Sutra answered. *The notations describe personal experimentation and refinement over decades.*

This revelation added another dimension to Wei's understanding of the Order's suppression of alternative cultivation paths. If memory could be used as currency for power, it represented a resource beyond the Order's control—something they couldn't regulate or restrict.

As Wei prepared to leave the temple complex, he noticed something strange on a fallen stone block near the entrance. Approaching it, he saw what appeared to be writing etched into the surface—fresh marks that cut through centuries of weathering.

The message was simple: "Wei Liang, disciple of the Azure Peak Sect, born in Willow Creek Village."

Wei stared at the writing in confusion. It was his handwriting, but he had no recollection of carving the message. More disturbing was the information it contained—he had forgotten the name of his village until reading it here.

*Memory externalization,* Sutra explained. *You instinctively preserved critical identity information during the conversion process.*

Wei ran his fingers over the etched characters. Had some part of him recognized the danger of what he was doing and taken precautions? Or was this a natural consequence of the technique—memories finding physical anchors before their complete dissolution?

Either way, it represented both warning and opportunity. If he continued using memory as cultivation fuel, he would need more permanent methods of preserving his identity. The stone carving was crude but effective—a physical record immune to the erosion of his internal recollections.

"I need to be more systematic," Wei decided. "If I'm going to sacrifice memories, I need to record the essential ones first."

*A wise precaution,* Sutra agreed. *The pendant mentions practitioners who maintained extensive memory archives—physical records of experiences they intended to sacrifice.*

Wei took a final look at the temple before continuing his journey. His energy reserves were replenished, his core stabilized, but the cost had been higher than he'd anticipated. Parts of his past were now irretrievably lost, converted to power that flowed through his meridians.

As he walked away, he began mentally cataloging the memories he considered essential to his identity—the experiences he would protect at all costs or record before sacrificing. His name. His purpose. His betrayal. His determination to survive and understand the truth about cultivation.

Everything else, he realized with a mixture of liberation and dread, was potentially currency—fuel for the path he had chosen. The Order taught that a cultivator's memories were sacred records of their journey toward enlightenment. Wei was discovering they could be something else entirely: resources to be spent in pursuit of power.

The implications were both terrifying and exhilarating. If memories could be converted to energy, what other fundamental assumptions about cultivation might be wrong? What other resources might exist beyond the Order's carefully controlled framework?

These questions accompanied Wei as he left the temple complex behind, moving deeper into the Shattered Wastes with renewed purpose and energy—and slightly less of himself than when he had arrived.
