# Chapter 5: The Central Ruins

The expedition reached the central ruins by late afternoon of their second day in the Wastes. What had once been a magnificent sect compound now stood as a testament to the cataclysm's power—massive structures of stone and crystal jutting from the ground at impossible angles, some seeming to defy gravity entirely. Spiritual formations, once designed to protect and enhance the sect's territory, now manifested as visible distortions in the air, creating shimmering barriers that flickered in and out of existence.

Inner Disciple Feng called the group to halt at a relatively stable area approximately two hundred paces from the ruins' outer perimeter. "We establish base camp here," he announced. "No one approaches the ruins until proper assessment is complete."

The disciples moved with practiced efficiency to set up the camp, establishing defensive formations and monitoring arrays. Wei worked alongside the other servant disciples, setting up supply stations and preparing the evening meal. His outward actions remained perfectly aligned with his role, giving no indication of the internal process that had begun since his encounter with Sutra.

"The second inversion requires you to identify your meridian channels," Sutra instructed within Wei's consciousness as he worked. "Not to fill them with spiritual energy as conventional cultivation teaches, but to hollow them further."

Wei maintained his external focus on his tasks while directing his awareness inward, following Sutra's guidance to locate the energy pathways that conventional cultivation would have filled with spiritual power. In his case, these channels had always been present but dormant—unable to accumulate the energy that powered cultivation techniques.

"Yes," Sutra confirmed as Wei identified the primary meridian running from his lower abdomen to his chest. "Now, rather than attempting to fill this channel, focus on creating emptiness within it—a void that pulls rather than a vessel that contains."

The concept was counterintuitive yet somehow resonated with Wei's natural state. As he worked on establishing the camp perimeter, he simultaneously practiced this internal technique, creating a subtle hollowing sensation along his central meridian.

"Good," Sutra approved. "The Hollow Awakening progresses. Where conventional cultivators spend years building foundations, you create absence. Where they accumulate, you empty."

Wei's concentration was interrupted when Outer Disciple Mei approached, carrying sensing equipment. "Servant Wei," she said, her tone less dismissive than most disciples when addressing servants, "help me establish the monitoring array at the eastern perimeter."

Wei bowed and followed her to the designated position, carrying the delicate instruments she would use to measure the ruins' spiritual emanations. As they worked together, Mei occasionally glanced at him with subtle curiosity.

"You've been different since your separation incident yesterday," she observed quietly, adjusting one of the sensing crystals. "More... present, somehow."

Wei kept his expression neutral, though internally he noted the danger of being perceived as changed. "This one is merely more attentive after experiencing the dangers of the Wastes directly," he replied, the practiced humility of a servant disciple masking his true thoughts.

Mei seemed about to press further when the monitoring array suddenly activated, its crystals glowing with unexpected intensity. "That's strange," she murmured, examining the readings. "The ruins are emitting spiritual resonance patterns I've never seen documented."

Wei observed the display, recognizing elements that connected to what Sutra had shown him about inverse energy flows. The ruins weren't merely damaged—they were actively operating according to principles that contradicted conventional cultivation understanding.

"Almost like they're breathing in reverse," Wei murmured, echoing his earlier observation that had caught Mei's attention.

She glanced at him sharply. "Yes, exactly that. How would you know such a thing?"

Before Wei could formulate a safe response, Inner Disciple Feng approached, his expression severe. "Outer Disciple Mei, report on your findings."

Mei straightened immediately, turning her attention to her superior. "The ruins exhibit unusual spiritual resonance patterns, Senior Brother. They appear to be actively processing energy in ways that contradict standard cultivation principles."

Feng frowned, examining the monitoring array himself. "Document everything precisely. This may explain why the Order has shown interest in this region."

As they discussed the implications, Wei maintained his properly deferential posture while absorbing every detail of their conversation. The ruins clearly contained elements related to the Forgotten Path—perhaps even the original sect that had developed the Inverse Meridian Theory before the cataclysm.

"The ruins were once the Boundless Meridian Sect," Sutra confirmed within Wei's mind, responding to his unspoken question. "One of the primary centers for cultivation research before the cataclysm. Their explorations into alternative energy flows were deemed dangerous by more conservative sects—a view that became dominant after the cataclysm."

Wei processed this information while completing his assigned tasks, helping to secure the monitoring equipment as Mei continued her analysis. The connection between these ruins and his newly discovered path created both opportunity and danger—the expedition might uncover knowledge valuable to his development, but also increase scrutiny that could expose his activities.

As evening approached, the expedition completed its base camp establishment. Inner Disciple Feng called the disciples together to announce the plan for the following day.

"We will conduct a preliminary exploration of the outer ruins at dawn," he stated. "Inner disciples will lead three separate teams to assess different sections of the compound. Outer disciples will document findings and monitor spiritual fluctuations. Servant disciples will maintain base camp security and prepare for artifact transport."

The assignments were standard expedition protocol, though Wei noted that his restriction to central position meant he would remain at base camp rather than accompanying any exploration team. This presented both limitation and opportunity—he would have less access to the ruins directly but more freedom to continue his internal practice without close observation.

As the disciples dispersed to their evening duties, Wei became aware of a subtle change in the Wastes around them. The ambient spiritual energy, already distorted compared to the normal world, began shifting in patterns that seemed to respond to the expedition's presence. The crystallized formations surrounding their camp emitted faint luminescence that pulsed in rhythms similar to what Wei had observed in the formation where he encountered Sutra.

"The ruins recognize kindred energy," Sutra explained. "Your beginning inversions create resonance with the lingering formations. Be cautious—others may notice if the response intensifies."

Wei acknowledged this warning, carefully moderating his internal practice as he completed his evening tasks. The last thing he needed was to draw attention through unusual spiritual phenomena that others might connect to his presence.

As night fell over the camp, the ruins revealed new properties. Structures that had appeared solid in daylight now showed ghostly luminescence, revealing architectural details that had been invisible before. Formations etched into the ancient buildings glowed with pale blue light, creating patterns that shifted and flowed like living things.

From his position at the edge of camp, Wei observed Inner Disciple Feng and several outer disciples documenting these phenomena, their expressions revealing mixture of scientific curiosity and underlying unease. The ruins clearly operated according to principles that challenged their understanding of cultivation fundamentals.

"They see but do not comprehend," Sutra commented. "Their training blinds them to alternative possibilities. What appears as corruption or damage to them is actually a different form of order."

Wei considered this as he prepared for the night watch rotation. His assigned shift would come in the deepest hours of night, providing opportunity for both observation and continued practice away from scrutiny.

When most of the camp had retired to their tents, Wei sat in meditation posture at his assigned watch position, outwardly performing his duty while inwardly continuing the inversions Sutra had begun teaching him. The process felt increasingly natural—not forcing change but allowing his inherent emptiness to express itself in structured ways.

"The third inversion involves memory," Sutra instructed. "Conventional cultivation builds upon accumulated experience, creating layers of spiritual understanding that reinforce each other. The Forgotten Path inverts this process—we cultivate through strategic forgetting, creating space where there was solidity."

Wei focused on this concept, identifying memories that could be hollowed rather than reinforced. He began with simple physical memories—the sensation of walking, the weight of objects in his hands, the texture of fabric against skin. Rather than strengthening these impressions, he practiced creating distance from them, establishing a void between experience and awareness.

"Excellent," Sutra approved. "You progress more quickly than expected. Your years of invisible existence have already trained you in aspects of detachment that most would struggle to achieve."

As Wei deepened this practice, he became aware of movement at the edge of his perception—a flickering shadow near the ruins that didn't match the established patrol patterns of the expedition's sentries. He shifted his attention outward, maintaining his meditative posture while scanning the darkness.

There—a figure moving with deliberate stealth along the ruins' perimeter. The silhouette suggested neither disciple nor servant but something else entirely—taller than human proportion, with an oddly fluid quality to its movement.

"A void-touched entity," Sutra identified. "Neither fully creature nor spirit but something transformed by prolonged exposure to the Wastes' unique properties."

Wei considered his options. Protocol required alerting the camp to any unusual sightings, yet doing so would draw attention and potentially interrupt the exploration planned for morning. Moreover, something about the entity's movement suggested purpose rather than random wandering—it appeared to be observing the camp with intelligence.

"It senses your inversions," Sutra confirmed. "Void-touched entities often respond to energies that resemble their own transformed state. Your practice creates resonance that attracts its attention."

This created immediate concern. If the entity was drawn specifically to Wei's activities, alerting the camp might lead to questions about why it had approached his position particularly.

Before Wei could decide on a course of action, the entity shifted direction, moving away from the camp and deeper into the ruins. Its departure seemed deliberate rather than random, almost as if inviting pursuit.

"It offers opportunity," Sutra suggested. "Such entities sometimes guard knowledge or artifacts from the Forgotten Age. However, following would require leaving your assigned position—a significant risk given your current restrictions."

Wei weighed the potential value against the certain punishment if discovered absent from his post again. His first priority remained avoiding exposure before he had developed sufficient understanding of the Forgotten Path to protect himself.

"A prudent choice," Sutra acknowledged as Wei decided to remain at his post. "Other opportunities will arise. The ruins have stood for centuries—their secrets will not disappear in a single night."

Wei continued his watch duty, though he maintained awareness of the ruins' perimeter in case the entity returned. The remainder of his shift passed without further incident, and he was relieved by another servant disciple as scheduled.

Rather than retiring immediately, Wei took a circuitous route back to his tent, positioning himself to observe the ruins from a different angle. The luminescent patterns had shifted again, now forming what appeared to be directional indicators—lines of light that converged toward a specific section of the compound.

"The Heart Chamber," Sutra identified. "The central cultivation hall where the Boundless Meridian Sect conducted their most significant research. If anything of true value remains in these ruins, it would be there."

Wei committed the location to memory, noting that it lay in the western section of the ruins—an area assigned to Inner Disciple Feng's personal exploration team for the morning. This created both challenge and opportunity; following that team would be difficult given his camp restrictions, but their discoveries might reveal information valuable to his development.

He finally retired to his tent, continuing his inversion practices as he drifted toward sleep. Unlike conventional meditation, which typically required full wakefulness, the Forgotten Path's inversions could progress during transitional states of consciousness—the boundaries between waking and sleeping providing fertile ground for hollowing rather than building.

"The Hollow Awakening advances well," Sutra noted as Wei's consciousness began to blur. "Soon you will be ready for the first manifestation—the Echo Chamber."

---

Dawn arrived with unusual gentleness for the Wastes, a gradual lightening rather than the abrupt transitions they had experienced previously. The expedition awakened to find the ruins transformed in daylight—structures that had glowed with ethereal luminescence now appeared more solid, though still distorted in ways that defied conventional architecture.

Inner Disciple Feng gathered the exploration teams after a brief morning meal. "We proceed as planned," he announced. "Team One will investigate the eastern section, Team Two the southern approach, and I will lead Team Three to the western chambers. Base camp remains fully staffed and on alert for void fluctuations."

Wei maintained his assigned position with the base camp team, helping prepare equipment that the exploration teams might need upon return. As the teams departed toward their designated sections of the ruins, he focused on his internal practice while monitoring the camp perimeter.

"The Echo Chamber forms when sufficient hollowing has occurred in your central meridian," Sutra explained. "Unlike conventional cultivation's dantian, which accumulates and compresses spiritual energy, the Echo Chamber expands through absence, creating space where spiritual impressions can resonate without being captured."

Wei continued the hollowing technique, aware of a growing sensation of spaciousness within his chest—not emptiness in the sense of loss but openness that allowed greater perception. As this internal space expanded, he became increasingly sensitive to the spiritual emanations from the ruins, perceiving patterns that had previously been invisible to him.

His practice was interrupted when the camp's alert formations suddenly activated, signaling distress from one of the exploration teams. The base camp disciples immediately moved to response positions, preparing to provide support if needed.

Minutes later, two outer disciples emerged from the western section of the ruins, supporting a third between them who appeared injured. Wei recognized them as members of Inner Disciple Feng's team, their expressions showing mixture of pain and confusion.

"Void pocket collapse," one explained as they reached the camp perimeter. "Senior Brother Feng found a sealed chamber. When the seal was broken, the pocket inverted—Disciple Zhao was caught in the backlash."

The injured disciple was brought to the medical station, where the expedition's healing specialist examined him. "His meridians show signs of inversion," the healer reported with concern. "The spiritual energy is flowing backward through his channels, causing system collapse."

Wei observed this diagnosis with particular interest, recognizing the connection to the principles Sutra had been teaching him. What appeared as damage to the conventional cultivator was actually a forced initiation into inverse energy flows—painful and dangerous when unexpected, but potentially transformative if properly understood.

"Where is Inner Disciple Feng?" asked the base camp coordinator, noting the senior disciple's absence.

"Still in the chamber," replied one of the returned disciples. "He ordered us to bring Zhao to safety while he continued investigating. The chamber contained artifacts that appeared intact despite the void pocket collapse."

This news created visible tension among the base camp disciples. Protocol dictated that no disciple should remain alone in potentially dangerous ruins, regardless of rank or ability. Inner Disciple Feng's decision to continue solo exploration violated this fundamental safety principle.

"Prepare a rescue team," the coordinator ordered. "We need to extract Senior Brother Feng immediately."

As the rescue team assembled, Wei continued his assigned tasks while processing this development. The chamber they described—located in the western section and protected by specialized seals—matched Sutra's description of the Heart Chamber where the Boundless Meridian Sect had conducted their primary research.

"A significant discovery," Sutra confirmed. "If Feng has indeed accessed the Heart Chamber, he may have found records of the Inverse Meridian Theory in their original form—far more complete than the fragments you've pieced together from prohibited texts."

This created both opportunity and danger. Such records would be invaluable to Wei's development on the Forgotten Path, but if brought back to Azure Peaks Sect, they would likely be surrendered to the Order for suppression or destruction. His window to access this knowledge might be extremely limited.

The rescue team departed toward the western ruins, leaving the base camp under heightened alert status. Wei found himself assigned to perimeter monitoring, a position that provided clear view of the ruins while maintaining his restriction to camp boundaries.

From this vantage point, he observed something the others had missed—subtle changes in the luminescent patterns flowing through the ruins' structures. What had been relatively random distributions of light now showed clear directionality, all flowing toward the western section where the Heart Chamber had been discovered.

"The ruins are responding to activation," Sutra explained. "The breaking of the seal has reawakened dormant formations throughout the compound. The Boundless Meridian Sect designed their facilities to function as integrated wholes—each part responding to changes in others."

Wei watched this process with fascination, recognizing patterns that resonated with his developing understanding of inverse energy flows. The ruins weren't merely damaged remnants but partially functional systems operating according to principles the current cultivation world had chosen to forget.

His observations were interrupted when the camp alert formations activated again, this time with greater intensity. Moments later, a massive spiritual disturbance erupted from the western ruins—a column of inverted energy visible even to non-cultivators as a darkness that consumed light rather than emitting it.

The base camp erupted into controlled chaos, disciples moving to defensive positions as the disturbance expanded. Wei maintained his assigned post, though his attention was divided between external events and internal awareness as the phenomenon created unexpected resonance with his developing Echo Chamber.

"A major seal has been broken," Sutra identified. "Not merely the chamber entrance but something contained within. The inverted energy signature suggests a preservation formation designed to protect core knowledge of the Inverse Meridian Theory."

The rescue team emerged from the ruins at a run, supporting Inner Disciple Feng between them. Unlike the previously injured disciple, Feng showed no physical damage but appeared to be in some form of spiritual shock—his eyes open but unfocused, his cultivation aura fluctuating in unstable patterns.

"Get him to the medical station immediately," ordered the base camp coordinator. "What happened in there?"

"He accessed a sealed artifact," reported one of the rescue team members. "Some kind of crystal recording device. When he activated it, the energy backlash created the disturbance you see now. We extracted him, but the artifact remains in the chamber."

Wei processed this information with careful neutrality, though internally his interest intensified dramatically. A crystal recording device containing knowledge of the Inverse Meridian Theory would be precisely the resource he needed to advance his understanding of the Forgotten Path.

"The opportunity presents itself," Sutra noted. "But accessing it would require breaking your restrictions and entering the ruins alone—an extreme risk given the current alert status."

Before Wei could consider this further, a new development demanded everyone's attention. Three figures had appeared at the edge of the camp perimeter—cultivators wearing the distinctive gray robes and silver insignia of the Order of Sixfold Balance. Their arrival created immediate tension throughout the camp, disciples straightening their postures and adjusting their expressions to show appropriate deference.

"Representatives of the Order," announced the lead figure, a woman whose cultivation aura suggested Enforcer rank—significantly above anyone in the Azure Peaks expedition. "This area is now under restriction by Order directive. All exploration activities will cease immediately, and all discoveries will be surrendered for evaluation."

The base camp coordinator stepped forward, bowing with formal respect. "Honored Enforcers, we are a sanctioned expedition from Azure Peaks Sect with proper authorization for these ruins."

"Your authorization is superseded," the Enforcer replied without emotion. "The disturbance emanating from the western chambers indicates activation of prohibited knowledge. Protocol requires immediate containment."

The coordinator hesitated, clearly uncertain how to proceed without Inner Disciple Feng's leadership. The injured senior disciple remained under treatment, his condition apparently serious enough to prevent him from addressing the situation.

"We will comply with the Order's directive," the coordinator finally stated, making the only decision available. "Our discoveries are at your disposal."

The Enforcers moved through the camp with practiced efficiency, examining documentation and questioning disciples about their observations. When they reached the medical station, they spent considerable time with the healing specialist, discussing Inner Disciple Feng's condition in low voices that prevented others from overhearing.

Wei maintained his assigned position, presenting the perfect image of an unremarkable servant disciple while observing everything with careful attention. The Order's arrival created significant complications but also potential opportunity—their focus on the senior disciples might create openings for less noticed members of the expedition.

"They will seal the Heart Chamber permanently," Sutra predicted. "The Order has spent centuries systematically eliminating all traces of the Inverse Meridian Theory. This discovery represents a significant breach in their suppression efforts."

Wei considered his options carefully. Attempting to access the chamber while Order Enforcers were present would be suicidal. Yet allowing them to seal it without extracting the knowledge it contained would forfeit the very opportunity he had come to the Wastes to find.

As he weighed these considerations, Wei noticed something unusual about the Order Enforcers' interaction with the ruins. Unlike the expedition disciples, who had responded to the distorted spiritual environment with varying degrees of discomfort, the Enforcers moved through the same space with complete ease—as if they possessed some protection against or adaptation to the Wastes' unique properties.

"They are not what they appear," Sutra observed. "The Order maintains special divisions trained to operate in the Wastes—cultivators who have been partially exposed to inverse principles while remaining loyal to conventional doctrine. They understand enough of what they suppress to function effectively as suppressors."

This insight suggested the Order's relationship with forbidden knowledge was more complex than simple rejection. They maintained controlled access to what they denied others—preserving understanding of inverse principles precisely to prevent their re-emergence in the wider cultivation world.

The Enforcers completed their initial assessment of the camp and gathered the senior-most remaining disciples for consultation. Their discussion was conducted with formal politeness but clear authority—the expedition would be permitted to return to Azure Peaks Sect with their general observations, but all specific findings related to the Heart Chamber would be classified and surrendered to the Order.

"We will establish containment protocols for the western chambers," the lead Enforcer announced. "Your expedition will prepare for departure tomorrow morning. No one is to approach the ruins until your departure."

This directive created visible disappointment among the disciples, though none dared voice objection. The opportunity to study a relatively intact Forgotten Age site was rare, and having it cut short by Order intervention represented significant loss of potential knowledge and advancement.

For Wei, the timeline created both urgency and opportunity. A single night remained before the expedition would depart, leaving the ruins under Order control. If he intended to access the Heart Chamber, it would need to happen during the darkness hours when both the camp and the Order representatives might be less vigilant.

As the day progressed toward evening, Wei continued his assigned tasks while observing the Order Enforcers' movements. They established a rotation that kept at least one of their number actively monitoring the ruins at all times, with particular focus on the western section where the Heart Chamber was located.

"Their vigilance will be difficult to circumvent," Sutra acknowledged. "However, your developing inversions provide certain advantages they may not anticipate. The Echo Chamber, once fully formed, allows perception and movement that conventional spiritual senses might miss."

Wei continued his internal practice throughout the day, accelerating the hollowing process that would complete his Echo Chamber formation. By evening meal, he could perceive a distinct space within his chest—not physical but spiritual, a region where conventional energy flows inverted and created resonance with similar patterns in his environment.

As night fell over the camp, the expedition settled into subdued routine. Inner Disciple Feng had regained consciousness but remained under medical observation, his spiritual core showing signs of instability that would require specialized treatment upon return to Azure Peaks. The Order Enforcers maintained their rotation, one actively patrolling while the others rested.

Wei's night watch assignment had been changed due to the heightened security—he was now paired with an outer disciple rather than monitoring alone. This created additional challenge for any potential movement toward the ruins, requiring him to either abandon his post openly or somehow evade his partner's awareness.

"The Echo Chamber offers a third option," Sutra suggested as Wei considered his limitations. "With sufficient hollowing, you can create a state of perceptual inversion—remaining physically present while projecting awareness beyond your immediate location."

This technique represented advancement beyond what Wei had anticipated achieving so quickly, but the urgency of the situation demanded attempting it. As he maintained his watch position beside the outer disciple, he focused on deepening the hollowing process, creating greater resonance between his Echo Chamber and the inverted energy patterns emanating from the ruins.

The outer disciple showed no awareness of Wei's internal activity, maintaining vigilant observation of their assigned perimeter section while occasionally making notations in the watch log. This external normalcy provided cover as Wei pushed his practice further, guided by Sutra's precise instructions.

"The Echo Chamber expands not by growing larger but by becoming less defined," Sutra explained. "Its boundaries blur, allowing your awareness to resonate with similar inversions in your environment. Focus on the Heart Chamber's energy signature—let your hollowness align with its emptiness."

Wei directed his attention toward the western ruins, where the Heart Chamber's inverted energy created distinct patterns visible to his developing perception. As his Echo Chamber resonated with these patterns, he experienced a strange sensation of extension—his awareness stretching beyond his physical location while his body remained in place.

The experience was disorienting at first, perception splitting between his physical position at the watch post and a secondary awareness that moved toward the ruins. This projected consciousness lacked physical substance but could perceive the environment from its extended position, creating a form of spiritual reconnaissance.

"Remarkable progress," Sutra approved. "Few achieve this level of projection before reaching the second stage of the Forgotten Path. Your natural emptiness serves you well."

Wei's projected awareness approached the western ruins, navigating through the distorted structures with increasing confidence. He could perceive the Order Enforcer on patrol—a figure whose cultivation aura showed unusual patterns, conventional energy flows overlaid with controlled inversions that allowed operation in the Wastes without discomfort.

The Enforcer moved with methodical precision, following a pattern that created predictable gaps in coverage. Wei's projected awareness utilized these gaps, advancing toward the Heart Chamber during intervals when observation was directed elsewhere.

As he approached the chamber entrance, Wei perceived the damage caused by the earlier incident—a doorway whose sealing formations had been disrupted, creating unstable energy patterns that fluctuated between conventional and inverted flows. Beyond this threshold lay the chamber itself, its interior illuminated by the same pale blue luminescence that characterized the ruins at night.

Wei's projected awareness passed through the damaged entrance, experiencing momentary resistance as it crossed the boundary between spaces. Inside, the Heart Chamber revealed itself as a circular room whose walls were covered in formation patterns of extraordinary complexity—not merely etched into the surface but somehow embedded within the material itself, creating three-dimensional structures that shifted as they were observed.

At the chamber's center stood a pedestal of crystallized material similar to what Wei had encountered when meeting Sutra. Upon this pedestal rested an object that immediately captured his attention—a crystal sphere approximately the size of a human heart, its interior swirling with patterns that resembled galaxies in miniature.

"The Meridian Sphere," Sutra identified with something like reverence in its disembodied voice. "The primary recording device of the Boundless Meridian Sect, containing the complete theoretical framework of the Inverse Meridian Theory. I had not dared hope it survived the cataclysm."

Wei's projected awareness circled the sphere, examining it from multiple angles. The object showed no obvious damage despite the centuries since the cataclysm, its internal patterns continuing to shift and flow with hypnotic complexity.

"Can I extract information from it in this projected state?" Wei asked internally.

"Not directly," Sutra replied. "The Sphere requires physical interaction to transfer its knowledge. However, your projection can identify methods of access and potential obstacles to physical retrieval."

Wei expanded his awareness to encompass the entire chamber, noting details that would be relevant for potential physical entry. The damaged entrance remained the primary access point, though the unstable energy patterns there would make passage challenging. The Order Enforcer's patrol pattern left approximately three minutes of uncovered time during each rotation—barely sufficient for entry and exit if perfectly timed.

Most concerning was the Sphere itself—it appeared to be integrated with the pedestal rather than simply resting upon it, suggesting removal might trigger additional security measures or destabilize the already precarious energy balance within the chamber.

"The Sphere was designed to be accessed, not removed," Sutra confirmed. "Attempting to separate it from its pedestal would likely trigger catastrophic energy release. However, brief physical contact would allow partial knowledge transfer—enough to significantly advance your understanding of the Forgotten Path."

Wei's projected awareness lingered in the chamber, absorbing as much detail as possible while maintaining the connection to his physical body at the watch post. The effort of sustaining this divided perception grew increasingly taxing, his inexperience with the technique limiting its duration.

"You must return before exhaustion compromises your control," Sutra advised. "What you've learned is sufficient to attempt physical access if you choose that path."

Wei withdrew his projected awareness, the perception retracting back toward his physical form with increasing speed as he released the technique. The return created momentary disorientation as his consciousness reintegrated, perception once again limited to his immediate surroundings.

The outer disciple beside him showed no sign of having noticed anything unusual, continuing his methodical observation of the perimeter. Wei's absence had been entirely spiritual rather than physical, leaving no external evidence of his exploration.

As his awareness fully settled back into his body, Wei processed what he had learned. The Meridian Sphere represented invaluable knowledge—perhaps the most complete record of the Inverse Meridian Theory still existing in the world. Accessing it physically would advance his development by years or even decades compared to the gradual instruction Sutra could provide alone.

Yet the risks were substantial. Leaving his post would violate direct orders, potentially resulting in severe punishment upon return to Azure Peaks. Encountering the Order Enforcer would have far worse consequences—the Order did not treat violations of their directives lightly, particularly when forbidden knowledge was involved.

"The choice remains yours," Sutra stated. "The Forgotten Path cannot be walked through compulsion—only through deliberate inversion of conventional limitations."

Wei considered his options as the night deepened around the camp. The expedition would depart in the morning, leaving the ruins under Order control indefinitely. This might be his only opportunity to access knowledge that had been systematically erased from the cultivation world for centuries.

The decision, when it came, felt less like choice and more like recognition of what had always been inevitable. Wei had not come to the Wastes seeking safety or conformity—he had come pursuing power denied to him by birth and circumstance. The Meridian Sphere offered exactly what he had always sought: knowledge that could transform emptiness into strength.

As the outer disciple made another entry in the watch log, Wei began preparing himself for what would come next. The path forward was dangerous but clear. When the opportunity presented itself, he would enter the Heart Chamber and touch the Meridian Sphere, accepting whatever consequences followed.

The invisible servant would take his first visible action—and the cultivation world would eventually be forced to see what it had chosen to forget.
