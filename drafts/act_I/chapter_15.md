# Chapter 15: The Bonebrand Hunter

The ravine's walls loomed over Wei Liang like ancient sentinels, their surfaces etched with crystalline patterns that caught the dim light filtering through the perpetual haze of the Shattered Wastes. Three days had passed since his encounter with Ru Yun at the convergence point, and the partial stabilization of his Fractured Core had held—barely. Each pulse of energy through his meridians sent spiderwebbing cracks through the temporary structure, a constant reminder of his precarious condition.

Wei pressed his back against the ravine wall, listening. The silence of the Wastes was never truly silent—those with the right perception could hear the whispers of reality fraying at its edges, the soft hiss of void energy seeping through cracks in existence. But now another sound intruded: the deliberate crunch of boots on crystallized ash, moving with the measured pace of a hunter.

*Someone approaches from the north ridge,* Sutra observed. *Not Void Hunters—different movement pattern.*

Wei nodded, extending his perception outward. The approaching figure's cultivation signature was unlike the Order's enforcers—rawer, less disciplined, but powerful in its own right. A scavenger, perhaps, or one of the Wastes' many predators who hunted other cultivators for their cores.

"Single target," Wei whispered. "Heavy spirit weapon, probably a cleaver or axe from the weight distribution."

He had two choices: retreat deeper into the ravine or confront the hunter. Retreat meant delaying his journey to the next convergence point where he might complete his core stabilization. Confrontation meant testing his partially stabilized core in combat for the first time.

*Your current condition limits combat duration to approximately four minutes before fracture progression becomes critical,* Sutra calculated. *Recommend avoiding direct energy expenditure.*

Wei considered this as he studied the approaching figure through a narrow gap in the rocks. The hunter was tall and broad-shouldered, his body wrapped in strips of leather and cloth that had once been white but were now stained with the gray ash of the Wastes. Most distinctive was his mask—a human skull with spiraling patterns carved into the bone, glowing faintly with amber light.

"Bonebrand," Wei muttered, recognizing the signature cultivation style. Bonebrand practitioners harvested the bones of powerful cultivators, inscribing them with spirit runes to channel and amplify their own energy. The skull mask wasn't mere decoration—it was a cultivation tool that enhanced perception.

The hunter paused at the ravine's entrance, head tilting as he scanned the area. The amber glow in his mask's eye sockets pulsed, and Wei felt a sweep of perception energy pass over him.

"I know you're there, void-touched," the hunter called, his voice distorted by the mask. "I've been tracking your energy signature for two days." He unslung a massive cleaver from his back, its edge notched and stained. "The Order pays well for specimens like you, but your bones will be worth more to me than their gold."

Wei remained still, calculating. The hunter knew his location but hadn't spotted him precisely. The ravine offered multiple escape routes, but running would only delay the inevitable—and his core couldn't afford the strain of prolonged evasion.

*He believes you weakened,* Sutra noted. *His approach lacks caution appropriate for confronting Fractured Core practitioner.*

"Then let's use that," Wei decided.

He stepped out from behind the rocks, deliberately stumbling as if exhausted. "I'm not what you're looking for," he called, voice raspy. "Just a failed disciple trying to survive."

The hunter laughed, the sound hollow through his mask. "Your cultivation signature says otherwise, void-touched. I've hunted your kind before." He advanced, cleaver held low. "The Order wants you alive, but they don't specify what condition. How many limbs do you need to still qualify as a specimen?"

Wei backed away, maintaining distance while appearing weak. "The Order lies about what they want from people like me," he said, watching the hunter's movements carefully. "They don't contain void practitioners—they study them."

"Don't care what they do with you after I collect," the hunter replied, closing the distance with surprising speed. "Your bones will fuel my cultivation for months."

He lunged forward, cleaver arcing through the air with enough force to shatter stone. Wei sidestepped, the blade missing him by centimeters and striking the ravine wall, sending crystalline shards flying.

Wei felt his core fracture slightly with the sudden movement, pain lancing through his chest. He couldn't afford a prolonged fight.

"You're faster than you look," the hunter acknowledged, wrenching his cleaver from the wall. "But you're leaking void energy like a punctured wine skin. How long before your core collapses completely?"

Instead of answering, Wei circled to position the hunter with his back to the narrowest part of the ravine. Each step was measured, each movement calculated to appear desperate while actually serving his strategy.

The hunter advanced again, this time more cautiously. "The longer you drag this out, the more painful I'll make it," he promised, the amber glow in his mask intensifying. "I've collected seventeen void-touched cores. Yours will make a fine addition."

"You've never encountered someone like me," Wei replied, his voice steadier now.

"All void practitioners say that," the hunter scoffed, launching into another attack.

This time, instead of dodging, Wei raised his hand, fingers spread in a formation that conventional cultivation would consider meaningless. As the cleaver descended, it met not flesh but a pocket of concentrated void energy that Wei had gathered between them.

The blade passed through the invisible barrier—and began to unravel.

The hunter stared in shock as his weapon's edge disintegrated, the metal breaking down into component particles that scattered like dust. "What—"

Wei didn't wait for him to recover. He stepped forward, palm striking the hunter's chest not with force but with precision. His fingers found the exact point where the hunter's cultivation core connected to his meridian system.

"Your bones won't help your cultivation," Wei said quietly. "Because you won't have any cultivation left to fuel."

The hunter tried to retreat, but Wei's fingers had already established connection. Unlike conventional combat techniques that injected destructive energy, Wei's approach created a controlled void—a space of absence that drew energy outward rather than pushing it in.

"Stop!" the hunter gasped, feeling his carefully accumulated cultivation energy begin to drain. "What are you doing to me?"

"Showing you what the void truly is," Wei answered, maintaining the connection despite the increasing strain on his fractured core. "Not destruction—unmaking."

The amber glow in the skull mask flickered and dimmed as Wei systematically unraveled the hunter's cultivation structure. Not destroying it—that would require enormous energy Wei couldn't afford to expend—but rather dismantling the connections between core and meridians, rendering the accumulated power inaccessible.

The hunter collapsed to his knees, his massive frame suddenly seeming smaller. "My cultivation," he whispered, horror evident even through the mask. "I can't feel it."

Wei stepped back, his own breathing labored from the effort. His core pulsed painfully, the fractures spreading despite his careful control. *Core destabilization at critical threshold,* Sutra warned. *Immediate stabilization required.*

"I've severed your connection to your core," Wei explained, leaning against the ravine wall for support. "Your energy is still there, but you can't access it. Consider it a more merciful fate than what you planned for me."

The hunter tore off his mask, revealing a face lined with scars and eyes wide with panic. Without the mask's enhancement, he seemed suddenly ordinary—just a man terrified of losing what defined him.

"Fix it," he begged, reaching for Wei with trembling hands. "I'll do anything. I've spent twenty years building my cultivation."

"And how many cultivators have you killed to enhance it?" Wei asked, already knowing the answer from the notches on the cleaver.

The hunter's silence was confirmation enough.

Wei pushed away from the wall, fighting to maintain his composure despite the pain radiating from his core. "Your connection will regenerate eventually," he said, though he wasn't entirely certain this was true. "Consider it an opportunity to reflect on your path."

"You can't leave me like this!" the hunter shouted, struggling to his feet. Without his cultivation energy, he moved like an old man, stiff and uncertain. "The Wastes will kill me!"

"Then find shelter," Wei suggested, already moving away. "The ruins to the east have water and enough residual energy to sustain basic functions. If you're resourceful, you might survive long enough for your connection to heal."

The hunter stared at him with a mixture of hatred and fear. "What are you?"

Wei paused, considering the question. What was he becoming? The techniques Sutra had taught him, enhanced by what he'd learned at the convergence point, were transforming him into something the cultivation world had no category for.

"I'm what happens when you're abandoned in the void," he finally answered. "I'm what grows in the spaces between what should be possible."

He left the hunter kneeling in the ravine, the man's desperate calls fading behind him. Each step sent fresh pain through Wei's destabilizing core, but he forced himself to maintain a steady pace. The encounter had cost him precious time and energy.

*Core stabilization critical,* Sutra reminded him. *The pendant's information suggests another convergence point seventeen kilometers northeast.*

Wei nodded, focusing on placing one foot before the other. The jade pendant Ru Yun had given him rested against his chest, its engravings shifting subtly against his skin. He hadn't yet deciphered all its secrets, but the fragments he'd understood had already proven invaluable.

As he crested the ravine's edge, Wei looked back once at the diminished figure of the hunter. The man who had confidently tracked him for days now seemed small against the vast desolation of the Wastes. It was the first time Wei had used his abilities against another cultivator—the first real test of what he was becoming.

The victory brought no satisfaction, only a cold certainty: he was changing into something unprecedented, something that could unmake the very foundations of cultivation. The Order was right to fear him, though not for the reasons they claimed.

Wei turned away and continued his journey, the pendant's knowledge guiding him toward the next convergence point. Behind him, the hunter's desperate cries faded into the whispers of the Wastes—one more voice among the countless echoes of those who had come seeking power and found only ruin.

But Wei wasn't seeking power. He was seeking survival. And perhaps, if Ru Yun's theories proved correct, something even more valuable: truth.
