# Chapter 7: The Hunters

Three days after Wei's departure from the expedition camp, the Order's specialized hunters entered the northeastern region of the Wastes. They moved with practiced precision through the distorted landscape, their gray robes modified with protective formations specifically designed for operation in unstable reality zones. Each carried equipment that conventional cultivators would find unfamiliar—devices that detected inverse energy patterns rather than conventional spiritual emanations.

The hunting party consisted of five members, their hierarchy clearly established through subtle variations in their otherwise uniform appearance. The leader, a woman whose face bore a distinctive scar running from temple to jaw, carried herself with the confidence of someone who had tracked and contained dozens of fugitives in environments most cultivators would consider uninhabitable.

"Target signature confirmed," announced the technical specialist, a thin man with wire-framed spectacles that glowed faintly blue. He adjusted dials on a device strapped to his forearm. "Approximately three kilometers northeast, moving deeper into the fluid zone."

"Formation pattern Crane," ordered the leader, making a sharp hand gesture. The team immediately shifted positions, forming a five-point star with precise spacing.

"The target's signature intensified approximately six hours ago," she informed her team as they established temporary position at the boundary between stable and fluid reality zones. "Pattern analysis suggests Echo Rooting has begun—earlier than expected for someone with his limited background."

"The guide-aspect must be accelerating his development," observed her second-in-command, a lean man whose eyes constantly scanned their surroundings with unnatural focus. "Remnant consciousness from before the cataclysm would have comprehensive understanding of progression techniques."

"Or he's simply more compatible with the Forgotten Path than we anticipated," suggested the only female hunter besides the captain. "Rootless vessels sometimes progress faster because there's nothing to unlearn."

The leader—Meiying—silenced further speculation with a sharp gesture. "Our advantage remains experience and established techniques. The target may have accessed significant knowledge, but application requires practice he hasn't had time to develop."

A crystalline formation nearby suddenly shattered, fragments hovering in mid-air before reassembling in a completely different configuration. The hunters didn't flinch, having trained extensively in the Wastes' unstable conditions.

"Fluid zone instability increasing," reported the fifth hunter, a broad-shouldered man carrying the heaviest equipment. "Recommend accelerating deployment before conditions deteriorate further."

The team established a perimeter formation designed to stabilize their immediate environment while extending their detection range. Each member took position at precise intervals, activating equipment that emitted subtle pulses of specialized energy—not conventional spiritual power but carefully calibrated inverse echoes designed to resonate with and reveal similar patterns.

"Detection grid active," reported the team's technical specialist after completing the formation's activation. "Range extends approximately three kilometers in current conditions. Resolution sufficient for directional tracking but not precise location."

A three-dimensional projection appeared above his device, showing swirling patterns of light with a darker void at its center—Wei's Echo Chamber signature.

The leader reviewed the initial readings with practiced assessment. "Signature present but diffuse. He's using the fluid reality zone for concealment—smart, but predictable. Conventional cultivators flee to populated areas; inverse practitioners seek environments that naturally resonate with their techniques."

She issued precise instructions for their approach—they would advance in formation, maintaining the detection grid while gradually penetrating deeper into the fluid reality zone. Their equipment and training would allow operation in conditions that would incapacitate conventional cultivators, though even they had limitations regarding how deep into instability they could safely venture.

"Remember containment protocols," she reminded her team as they prepared to advance. "The target must be captured intact for proper processing. Physical damage is acceptable if necessary for subdual, but his mind must remain functional for extraction procedures."

"What about the guide-aspect?" asked the female hunter. "Standard extraction would destroy it completely."

"Command was explicit," Meiying replied coldly. "The guide-aspect is classified as contamination. No preservation protocols authorized."

The hunters moved forward with coordinated efficiency, their formation adjusting automatically to accommodate the increasingly unstable environment. As they penetrated deeper into the fluid reality zone, gravity began fluctuating unpredictably, light behaved according to alternative physics, and spatial relationships became increasingly approximate rather than fixed.

The technical specialist stumbled as the ground beneath him suddenly rippled like water. The second-in-command caught his arm, stabilizing him before he could fall.

"Focus," Meiying commanded. "Your perception will lie to you here. Trust your training, not your senses."

Their specialized training allowed adaptation to these conditions, though not without cost. Each hunter continuously expended spiritual energy to maintain personal stability while contributing to the formation that supported their collective function. This expenditure created operational time limit—they could not maintain peak performance indefinitely in such hostile conditions.

"Signature strengthening," the technical specialist reported after they had advanced approximately two kilometers into the fluid zone. "Directional analysis indicates northeast quadrant, estimated distance remaining two to three kilometers depending on spatial consistency."

The projection above his device showed the void signature growing more defined, its boundaries sharper and its resonance patterns more complex.

The leader processed this information with slight frown. "He's deeper into instability than anticipated. Approaching operational safety threshold for standard containment procedures."

"Should we request backup from the barrier team?" asked her second-in-command.

She considered this option briefly before shaking her head. "Time-critical situation. The target's development is progressing rapidly—delay increases difficulty exponentially. We proceed as planned but accelerate timeline."

The hunting party increased pace, pushing deeper into the fluid reality zone where conventional physics became increasingly optional rather than mandatory. Their formation tightened, compensating for the greater instability by strengthening their collective stabilization effect.

The female hunter suddenly gasped, clutching her chest. "Something's wrong," she whispered. "It feels like—"

"Void resonance," Meiying identified immediately. "He's sensing our approach. Suppression equipment, now!"

The hunters activated protective devices on their belts, creating a barrier against the probing emptiness that had reached out toward them.

"One kilometer remaining," reported the technical specialist as their detection equipment registered stronger signature. "Signature characteristics changing—the Echo Rooting appears to be consolidating."

This development created visible concern among the hunters. Consolidation suggested the target was progressing through developmental stages more rapidly than their containment protocols had anticipated. If he established functional inverse techniques before they reached his position, the operation's difficulty would increase significantly.

"Prepare suppression equipment," the leader ordered. "Priority shifts to immediate neutralization of inverse capabilities upon contact."

The hunters adjusted their approach accordingly, readying specialized tools designed to disrupt inverse energy patterns. These devices represented the Order's most advanced counter-measures against forbidden cultivation techniques—technology developed through centuries of studying what they suppressed.

The broad-shouldered hunter activated a staff-like device that hummed with contained energy. "Suppression field primed," he reported. "Range thirty meters, full spectrum coverage."

As they closed final distance, the environment's instability intensified dramatically. Gravity shifted direction multiple times per minute, light manifested as solid objects before dissolving back into illumination, and spatial dimensions occasionally inverted or folded upon themselves. The hunters' formation strained against these conditions, their collective stabilization barely sufficient to maintain functional operation.

"Contact imminent," the technical specialist announced, his voice showing first signs of strain from the extended operation in extreme conditions. "Signature indicates stationary target, approximately two hundred meters ahead—assuming spatial consistency."

The leader signaled for final approach configuration. The hunters spread into practiced pattern designed to surround and contain rather than directly confront. Their movements became more deliberate, each step carefully placed to minimize disruption of the unstable environment that might alert their target.

The second-in-command suddenly froze, pointing ahead. "There—do you see it?"

Through the distorted landscape, a sphere of relative stability had formed—a perfect circle of calm amid the chaos of the fluid zone. Within it sat a figure in meditation posture, seemingly unaffected by the reality distortions raging around him.

They advanced through crystallized formations that defied conventional geometry, structures that appeared to exist in multiple states simultaneously. The detection equipment guided their approach, leading them toward a region where reality had stabilized slightly—not through natural processes but through deliberate manipulation.

"Artificial stabilization," the second-in-command observed quietly. "He's creating localized order within chaos."

"An advanced application for someone at his development stage," the leader acknowledged, her expression revealing mixture of professional concern and reluctant admiration. "The guide-aspect's influence is significant."

They reached position surrounding the stabilized zone, each hunter taking precisely calculated position to maximize containment effectiveness while minimizing detection probability. Through the distorted landscape, they could perceive their target—a figure seated in meditation posture within a roughly spherical region where reality maintained consistent properties despite the chaos surrounding it.

The leader observed the target carefully, noting details that would inform their approach. The servant disciple showed no external signs of conventional cultivation advancement—no visible aura, no spiritual pressure, nothing that would normally indicate developing power. Instead, he presented the opposite—an absence where presence should be, a void that somehow defined itself against the surrounding reality.

"Hollow Awakening complete, Echo Rooting advanced," she assessed based on decades of experience hunting practitioners of forbidden paths. "Approaching threshold for first manifestation techniques. Containment window closing rapidly."

She signaled for synchronized deployment of suppression equipment. Each hunter activated specialized devices that emitted precisely calibrated energy patterns—not attacking the target directly but establishing boundary conditions designed to disrupt inverse cultivation techniques specifically.

The effect was immediate and visible. The stabilized zone surrounding the target flickered as its supporting patterns encountered interference. The crystallized formations providing shelter destabilized, their structure becoming increasingly random rather than organized.

The target—Wei Liang—opened his eyes, his expression showing neither surprise nor fear but calm assessment. He rose from meditation posture with deliberate movement, scanning his surroundings with perception that clearly extended beyond conventional senses.

"Wei Liang," the leader called, stepping forward while maintaining her position in the containment formation. "By authority of the Order of Sixfold Balance, you are required to surrender for processing. Compliance will result in humane treatment."

Wei regarded her with steady gaze, his posture relaxed despite the obvious threat surrounding him. "Hunter Captain Meiying," he replied, the use of her name creating momentary surprise among the hunting party. "Your reputation precedes you. The Order's premier tracker of those who walk forgotten paths."

The leader—Meiying—maintained professional composure despite this unexpected recognition. "Your knowledge of Order personnel suggests deeper involvement with prohibited information than initially assessed. Surrender now and provide details of your information sources."

"I know all five of you," Wei continued, looking at each hunter in turn. "Technical Specialist Jiro, whose detection devices are unmatched in the Order. Second Commander Teng, whose eyes can track void fluctuations others can't see. Suppression Expert Kuron, whose equipment generates the most advanced containment fields in the Order's arsenal. And Hunter Lin, whose personal history with inverse practitioners gives her unique insight."

Lin—the female hunter—visibly tensed at this mention of her past.

Wei made no move to comply, his attention shifting between the hunters with analytical calm. "The Meridian Sphere contained comprehensive records, including Order containment protocols and personnel assignments. Your methods are known to me."

This revelation created visible tension among the hunting party. The Meridian Sphere's contents were supposed to be secured before any unauthorized access could occur. That the target had obtained operational intelligence about their methods represented significant security breach.

"Knowledge of our methods does not confer ability to counter them," Meiying stated, though her tone suggested less certainty than her words. "Your development, while unusually rapid, remains incomplete. You cannot hope to overcome five specialized hunters."

"I don't need to overcome you," Wei replied with simple directness. "I merely need to continue existing long enough to complete what I've begun. The Forgotten Path operates through persistence rather than confrontation."

As he spoke, the hunters became aware of subtle change in their surroundings. The suppression equipment, designed to disrupt inverse energy patterns, was having decreasing effect as the target appeared to be adapting to its interference—not by opposing it directly but by incorporating its patterns into his own development.

"He's using our suppression field as development catalyst," the technical specialist reported with professional alarm. "Inverse adaptation—turning counter-measures into advancement opportunity."

"Impossible," muttered Kuron, adjusting his equipment frantically. "The suppression field is calibrated specifically to disrupt Echo Chamber resonance."

Meiying recognized the technique from historical records—a fundamental principle of the Forgotten Path that conventional cultivation found difficult to counter. Where traditional approaches would resist interference, inverse methods incorporated it, transforming opposition into opportunity.

"Escalate to direct suppression," she ordered, abandoning the more subtle approach. "Containment priority supersedes all other considerations."

The hunters activated secondary equipment—devices that generated more aggressive counter-measures designed to forcibly disrupt any cultivation techniques, conventional or inverse. The surrounding environment reacted violently to this escalation, reality fluctuations intensifying as competing energy patterns created interference patterns.

Crystalline formations around them shattered and reformed rapidly, some growing toward the hunters like jagged spears. Teng barely dodged as one shot past his head.

"The environment is responding to his Echo Chamber," Lin warned. "He's not controlling it directly, but it's reacting to the resonance."

Wei remained centered within this chaos, his expression showing concentration rather than distress. The Echo Chamber within his chest resonated with the hunters' suppression field, not resisting but allowing it to pass through his hollowed meridians while extracting patterns useful for his development.

"Your techniques were designed to counter practitioners who achieved natural development," he observed as the hunters intensified their efforts. "My access to the Meridian Sphere provided comprehensive understanding rather than gradual discovery. The containment protocols you're using were documented in those records, along with their limitations."

This statement confirmed Meiying's growing concern—the target possessed not merely forbidden techniques but strategic knowledge of Order operations. The standard containment approach was proving ineffective against someone who had studied its design specifically.

"Formation adjustment," she commanded, signaling pattern change that her team executed with practiced precision. "Switch to Protocol Seven."

The hunters shifted positions, their equipment reconfiguring to generate entirely different suppression pattern—one designed specifically for situations where standard protocols had been compromised. This approach relied on principles that even the pre-cataclysm records might not have documented, developed by the Order centuries after the knowledge suppression began.

Wei's expression showed momentary uncertainty as the new pattern established itself around him. The stabilized zone he had created flickered more dramatically, its supporting structure encountering interference it hadn't been designed to accommodate.

"Interesting," he acknowledged, genuine curiosity evident in his voice. "This pattern wasn't documented in the Sphere's records. Your Order has continued development rather than merely preserving."

Meiying allowed herself slight satisfaction at having finally presented challenge the target hadn't anticipated. "The Order understands what it contains. Suppression requires comprehensive knowledge—including advancements beyond what was known before the cataclysm."

The hunting party tightened their formation, the Protocol Seven suppression field intensifying as they coordinated their equipment with practiced efficiency. The stabilized zone surrounding Wei contracted visibly, its boundaries becoming increasingly defined as the hunters' techniques forced it into smaller volume.

"It's working," Kuron reported, his voice tight with concentration. "His Echo Chamber is losing external resonance."

Wei closed his eyes briefly, his focus turning inward as he assessed his options. The Echo Chamber within his chest continued resonating with the hunters' suppression field, but the unfamiliar patterns created challenges his developing techniques struggled to incorporate.

"Your development is impressive but incomplete," Meiying stated, recognizing the target's difficulty. "Surrender now and your knowledge will be preserved during processing. Resistance will necessitate more aggressive measures that risk permanent damage."

Wei opened his eyes, his decision apparently made. "I acknowledge your tactical advantage," he replied with calm dignity. "But you misunderstand my objective. I'm not attempting to defeat you—merely to learn from this encounter."

Before Meiying could respond to this statement, Wei made his first offensive move—though "offensive" poorly described what occurred. Rather than attacking the hunters directly, he suddenly inverted his Echo Chamber's resonance, creating vacuum effect that pulled the suppression field's energy inward rather than resisting its pressure.

The result was immediate and dramatic. The carefully calibrated Protocol Seven field, designed to contract around its target with precise control, suddenly accelerated inward far beyond its intended parameters. The hunters' equipment overloaded from the unexpected energy flow, several devices emitting warning signals as their regulatory systems struggled to compensate.

Jiro's detection device exploded in a shower of sparks, burning his hand. Kuron's suppression staff began to vibrate violently, forcing him to drop it before it shattered. Lin stumbled backward as her protective amulet suddenly cracked down the middle.

"Field collapse imminent," warned the technical specialist, his hands moving rapidly over his secondary equipment in attempt to stabilize the deteriorating formation. "Containment integrity compromised."

"What's happening?" demanded Teng, his unnatural eyes widening as he witnessed something the others couldn't see. "The void patterns are inverting completely!"

Meiying recognized the technique from historical records—Void Consumption, a fundamental application of inverse cultivation that turned opponents' energy expenditure against them. The target wasn't generating power to overcome their suppression; he was creating emptiness that pulled their own power into imbalance.

"Disengage and reestablish!" she commanded, her team responding immediately by deactivating their equipment and moving to secondary positions.

The momentary disruption of the suppression field created opportunity Wei had apparently been waiting for. Instead of attempting to escape—which Meiying had anticipated and prepared for—he intensified his meditation posture, his Echo Chamber expanding rapidly as it absorbed the residual energy from the collapsed field.

The air around him began to shimmer, reality itself seeming to bend inward toward his seated form. The crystalline formations nearby twisted toward him like metal filings drawn to a magnet.

"He's accelerating development rather than fleeing," the second-in-command observed with professional concern. "Using our interruption as advancement opportunity."

"This isn't standard Echo Rooting," Lin added, her voice tight with recognition. "He's approaching manifestation stage already."

Meiying recognized the strategic approach—another fundamental principle of the Forgotten Path. Where conventional cultivators sought uninterrupted practice in controlled environments, inverse practitioners incorporated disruption and opposition directly into their development process.

"Reestablish containment immediately," she ordered, her team moving with renewed urgency to deploy their backup equipment.

But the brief window had been sufficient for Wei's purposes. As the hunters attempted to reestablish their suppression field, they found the target's Echo Chamber had undergone significant transformation—no longer merely resonating with its environment but actively defining the reality around it.

The space around Wei pulsed visibly, reality itself seeming to breathe in rhythm with his meditation. Where the hunters' suppression field attempted to establish boundaries, those boundaries simply folded inward, becoming part of Wei's expanding influence.

"First manifestation achieved," the technical specialist reported, his equipment displaying readings that confirmed what they could all perceive directly. "Echo Chamber externalization—ahead of projected development timeline."

"Impossible," whispered Kuron. "That should take weeks, not minutes."

Wei opened his eyes, his gaze now carrying subtle difference that all experienced hunters immediately recognized—the look of someone who had crossed threshold from theoretical knowledge to practical application. His first inverse technique had manifested, transforming him from fugitive with potential to practitioner with capability.

"Thank you for your contribution to my development," he stated with formal politeness that somehow carried no mockery despite the circumstances. "This encounter has proven more educational than I anticipated."

Meiying signaled for immediate escalation to final containment protocols—techniques reserved for situations where targets had manifested active capabilities. The hunters deployed their most advanced equipment, generating suppression field specifically designed to counter externalized Echo Chambers.

"Full spectrum containment," she ordered. "All frequencies, maximum intensity."

Under normal circumstances, this approach would have been effective against practitioner at Wei's development stage. The specialized field created interference patterns that disrupted the delicate resonance required for inverse techniques to function properly, essentially severing the connection between internal hollowness and external manifestation.

The hunters' equipment hummed with power, creating a visible dome of energy that enclosed Wei completely. For a moment, it seemed to work—the reality distortions around him stabilized, the pulsing rhythm of his Echo Chamber faltered.

But Wei's development had followed unconventional progression from the beginning. His access to the Meridian Sphere had provided comprehensive theoretical understanding that most practitioners would require years to accumulate. The guide-aspect, Sutra, offered experienced instruction that accelerated application of that knowledge. And now, the hunters' own containment efforts had inadvertently provided catalyst for manifestation that might otherwise have required weeks of dedicated practice.

As the specialized suppression field established itself around him, Wei neither resisted nor yielded. Instead, his Echo Chamber adapted to the interference patterns, incorporating them into its own resonance rather than attempting to overcome them. The hollowness within him expanded further, extending through his established meridian network and creating more defined connection with the surrounding environment.

The suppression dome began to warp inward, its energy flowing toward Wei rather than containing him. The hunters' equipment strained against this unexpected reversal, power regulators glowing red with overload warnings.

"He's using our containment field as development medium," Meiying realized, her extensive experience allowing recognition of what was occurring. "Each counter-measure we deploy provides new patterns for his Echo Chamber to incorporate."

"We're making him stronger," Lin stated flatly. "Everything we do accelerates his development."

This created fundamental dilemma for the hunting party. Their equipment and techniques, designed to suppress inverse cultivation, paradoxically provided exactly what the target needed for accelerated development. The more aggressively they attempted containment, the more rapidly his capabilities advanced.

Meiying made tactical decision based on decades of experience. "Disengage completely," she ordered, her team responding with immediate compliance despite their obvious surprise. "Establish observation perimeter only."

"Captain?" questioned Teng. "Standard protocol requires—"

"Standard protocol is counterproductive in this case," she cut him off. "Disengage now."

The hunters deactivated their suppression equipment, withdrawing to positions that maintained visual contact while minimizing energy projection that the target could potentially utilize. This approach contradicted standard protocols but reflected Meiying's assessment of their unique situation.

Wei observed this tactical shift with thoughtful expression. "An interesting decision," he noted. "Denying me further development catalyst while maintaining surveillance. Your reputation for adaptability is well-earned, Hunter Captain."

Meiying maintained professional detachment despite the unusual dialogue. Most containment operations involved minimal communication with targets, yet this situation had evolved beyond standard parameters in multiple respects.

"Your development pattern is unprecedented," she acknowledged, gathering information while her team established their new positions. "No recorded case exists of rootless practitioner achieving manifestation so rapidly, even with guide-aspect assistance."

"The Forgotten Path inverts conventional limitations," Wei replied, his tone suggesting academic discussion rather than confrontation between hunter and fugitive. "What appears as disadvantage becomes advantage. My absence of spiritual roots created perfect compatibility with inverse cultivation."

"You realize the Order will never stop pursuing you," Lin interjected, stepping forward slightly. "I've seen what happens to those who walk this path. It never ends well."

Wei studied her with curious expression. "Your personal history with inverse practitioners colors your perspective, Hunter Lin. The records mentioned your brother's case—though I suspect the Order's version differs from reality."

Lin's face hardened. "You know nothing about my brother."

"I know the Order classified him as contaminated when he discovered inverse techniques that might have healed his damaged meridians," Wei replied quietly. "I know you joined the hunters after his processing, perhaps seeking understanding of what happened to him."

"Enough," Meiying interrupted sharply. "Your situation remains untenable regardless of development speed. This region is surrounded. Additional Order resources are being deployed. Manifestation of inverse techniques, while impressive, doesn't alter the fundamental outcome."

Wei nodded, acknowledging this assessment without apparent concern. "I understand your perspective. From conventional viewpoint, my position appears hopeless—outnumbered, inexperienced, and trapped in hostile territory. But the Forgotten Path operates according to different principles."

As he spoke, subtle changes became visible in the environment surrounding him. The fluid reality zone, already unstable by nature, began shifting in patterns that suggested deliberate influence rather than random fluctuation. Spatial relationships became increasingly approximate, light behaved according to alternative physics, and gravity itself seemed to acknowledge multiple possible orientations simultaneously.

The ground beneath the hunters suddenly rippled violently. Kuron lost his footing, falling to one knee. Crystalline formations around them began to twist and reshape themselves, some growing toward the hunters like reaching fingers.

"Reality inversion," identified the technical specialist, his equipment displaying readings that confirmed visual observation. "He's not merely adapting to the fluid zone—he's actively influencing its properties."

"Impossible at his development stage," muttered Teng. "He shouldn't have this level of environmental control for months."

Meiying recognized the technique from historical records—another fundamental application of the Forgotten Path that conventional cultivation found particularly difficult to counter. Where traditional practitioners imposed stability upon chaotic environments, inverse cultivators embraced and enhanced instability, creating conditions where conventional techniques functioned poorly while inverse methods thrived.

"Maintain position but prepare for extraction if conditions deteriorate beyond operational parameters," she instructed her team, recognizing the changing tactical situation. "Priority shifts to intelligence gathering rather than immediate containment."

The hunters adjusted their approach accordingly, focusing on documenting the target's capabilities while maintaining sufficient distance to avoid direct influence from the intensifying reality distortions. Their equipment continued recording data that would prove valuable for future containment efforts, even if immediate capture now appeared increasingly unlikely.

Wei remained centered within the growing instability, his expression showing concentration but not strain. The Echo Chamber within him had established resonance with the fluid reality zone, creating feedback loop where each reinforced the other's properties. The environment became extension of his inverse cultivation, responding to his hollowness with its own increasing emptiness.

"The Order has misunderstood the Wastes since the cataclysm," he observed as the reality distortions expanded further. "This isn't damaged territory requiring containment—it's alternative expression of reality's fundamental nature. The emptiness here isn't absence but different form of presence."

A crystalline formation suddenly shot upward between Meiying and Teng, forcing them to jump apart. Another liquified beneath Jiro's feet, nearly causing him to sink before he leaped to solid ground.

Meiying made no response to this philosophical statement, though she noted it for inclusion in her eventual report. The target's perspective on the Wastes aligned with certain prohibited theoretical models that the Order had suppressed precisely because they challenged conventional understanding of reality's proper organization.

The reality distortions continued expanding, creating conditions that pushed against the hunters' operational limits. Spatial relationships became increasingly unreliable, distances stretching or compressing without apparent pattern. Light separated into component aspects that operated independently of each other, creating visual environment that conventional perception struggled to interpret coherently.

"Approaching safety threshold," reported the second-in-command, monitoring the team's collective condition. "Maintaining position becoming increasingly difficult."

Lin suddenly gasped, clutching her head. "Something's wrong," she whispered. "I can hear—voices—"

"Memory resonance," Wei identified, looking at her with what appeared to be genuine concern. "The fluid zone sometimes triggers suppressed recollections. Your brother's voice, perhaps?"

"Stay out of my head!" Lin snarled, drawing a weapon—a short blade that glowed with suppression energy.

"Stand down!" Meiying ordered sharply. "He's provoking emotional response to disrupt our formation."

Meiying assessed their situation with pragmatic calculation. The target had created conditions that made immediate containment impossible without unacceptable risk to her team. Continuing observation provided diminishing returns as the environment became increasingly hostile to conventional operation. The tactical decision was clear despite contradicting standard protocols.

"Initiate strategic withdrawal," she ordered. "Maintain data collection during extraction. We'll establish secondary containment perimeter at stable zone boundary."

The hunters began coordinated withdrawal, their formation adjusting to provide mutual support as they navigated the increasingly distorted environment. Their equipment continued recording the target's position and activities, though the reliability of this data decreased as reality itself became less consistently defined.

Wei made no move to pursue or hinder their withdrawal, remaining centered within the expanding zone of fluid reality. His expression suggested neither triumph nor relief but focused concentration on the developmental process their interruption had catalyzed.

"This isn't over, Wei Liang," Meiying called back as her team retreated. "The Order will send specialists next time—those who understand the Forgotten Path as well as you do."

"I look forward to meeting them," Wei replied with surprising sincerity. "Every encounter teaches something new."

As the hunting party reached safer territory where reality maintained more consistent properties, Meiying conducted preliminary assessment of their encounter. The target had demonstrated capabilities beyond what their intelligence had suggested possible, achieving manifestation stage despite minimal training time. The guide-aspect's influence clearly exceeded initial estimates, as did the knowledge transfer from the Meridian Sphere.

Most concerning was the target's apparent compatibility with inverse cultivation. His lack of conventional spiritual roots, rather than limiting his development, seemed to accelerate it—creating practitioner uniquely suited to path that operated through absence rather than presence. The implications extended beyond this specific case to fundamental questions about the Order's understanding of cultivation potential.

"Establish monitoring perimeter at safe distance," she instructed as her team reached the boundary between fluid and stable reality zones. "Maintain observation while I report to Command. This situation requires strategic reassessment."

The hunters deployed specialized equipment designed for long-range monitoring of inverse energy patterns. While direct observation had become impossible due to the environmental conditions, they could still track general location and development progression through detection of resonance patterns that extended beyond the immediate distortion zone.

"He knew about my brother," Lin said quietly, standing beside Meiying as they calibrated the monitoring equipment. "How could he possibly know that? Those records are sealed at the highest level."

"The Meridian Sphere contained more than just cultivation techniques," Meiying replied. "Historical records, personnel files, operational protocols—knowledge the Order has spent centuries containing."

"And now it's in the hands of someone perfectly suited to use it," Lin concluded grimly.

Meiying activated secure communication device, establishing connection with Order Command through channels specifically designed to function within the Wastes' distorted spiritual landscape. Her report was precise and comprehensive, detailing the encounter's progression, the target's demonstrated capabilities, and her tactical assessment of the situation.

The response from Command came quickly, suggesting the Order had already elevated this case to highest priority. New instructions reflected significant strategic adjustment—immediate containment was no longer primary objective. Instead, Meiying's team would maintain observation perimeter while specialized research division was deployed to assess the target's unique development pattern.

This shift from standard containment protocol to research-focused approach indicated the Order's recognition that Wei Liang represented something beyond routine forbidden cultivation case. His unprecedented development progression, combined with his access to comprehensive pre-cataclysm knowledge, created situation with broader implications for the Order's fundamental mission.

As Meiying relayed these new instructions to her team, she found herself considering the target's parting observation about the Wastes. Throughout her career hunting practitioners of forbidden paths, she had operated according to the Order's established understanding—that the Wastes represented damaged reality requiring containment and eventual restoration to proper form.

Yet her extensive experience had occasionally suggested alternative perspective, one that aligned uncomfortably with what the servant disciple had articulated. The Wastes didn't behave like damaged conventional reality but like different expression of reality's fundamental nature—one that conventional cultivation struggled to comprehend precisely because it operated according to inverse principles.

Such thoughts bordered on prohibited speculation, and Meiying dismissed them with practiced discipline. Her role was execution of the Order's directives, not philosophical questioning of their underlying assumptions. The target would be observed, studied, and eventually contained according to adjusted protocols. The knowledge he had accessed would be secured and suppressed as it had been for centuries.

The Order's mission would continue as it always had—maintaining stability through careful control of what cultivation paths humanity was permitted to explore. Alternative approaches, regardless of their potential validity, represented unacceptable risk to established order.

Yet as she established the monitoring perimeter according to her new instructions, Meiying found herself wondering—not for the first time in her long career—whether suppression of knowledge truly served humanity's advancement or merely preserved particular understanding of reality at the expense of others.

Such questions had no place in a Hunter Captain's thoughts. But they persisted nonetheless, echoing in emptiness she had never acknowledged within herself.

---

Deep within the fluid reality zone, Wei Liang continued his development with renewed focus. The hunters' intervention, rather than interrupting his progress, had accelerated it—providing practical application opportunity that theoretical knowledge alone could not supply.

"You handled that encounter remarkably well," Sutra observed as Wei stabilized the manifestation stage he had achieved under pressure. "Few practitioners achieve such rapid adaptation to opposition, particularly at early development stages."

Wei acknowledged this assessment while maintaining concentration on the Echo Chamber's externalization. The hollowness within his chest had established connection with the surrounding environment, creating resonance that allowed manipulation of reality's properties rather than merely adapting to them.

"The hunters' suppression techniques provided patterns I hadn't anticipated," he noted, analyzing what he had learned from the confrontation. "Their equipment generated interference specifically designed to disrupt inverse energy flows—knowledge I couldn't have gained from the Meridian Sphere alone."

"The Order understands what it suppresses," Sutra confirmed. "Their containment methods have evolved over centuries, incorporating insights gained from each practitioner they've processed. What you encountered represents accumulation of knowledge they deny to others while utilizing themselves."

This observation aligned with Wei's developing understanding of the Order's fundamental approach. They didn't merely prohibit alternative cultivation paths but maintained controlled access to them—preserving knowledge they deemed dangerous precisely to counter those who might rediscover it independently.

"They'll adjust their approach based on this encounter," Wei reasoned, considering tactical implications. "Direct containment attempts will be replaced by observation and study. They recognize that conventional suppression techniques accelerate rather than hinder my development."

"Yes," Sutra agreed. "Their next approach will likely involve specialized practitioners—those trained in counter-inverse techniques that operate through principles similar to your own. The Order maintains division of such cultivators specifically for situations where standard methods prove ineffective."

This created both challenge and opportunity. Confronting specialists with counter-inverse training would be significantly more dangerous than conventional hunters, but such encounter would also provide advanced development catalyst that Wei might otherwise require years to discover independently.

"We should relocate before they deploy their specialists," he decided, rising from meditation posture. "This encounter provided sufficient advancement for current stage. Further confrontation should occur only after I've fully integrated these developments."

Sutra's approval manifested as subtle warmth within Wei's consciousness. "Wise assessment. The Echo Chamber's externalization requires stabilization before additional techniques can be reliably manifested. Premature confrontation would risk developmental regression."

Wei began navigating deeper into the fluid reality zone, his newly manifested capabilities allowing more efficient movement through the distorted environment. Where previously he had adapted to the instability, now he actively influenced it—creating pathways where conventional perception would see only chaotic fluctuation.

The Echo Chamber within his chest maintained resonance with the surrounding reality, each reinforcing the other's properties in sustainable feedback loop. This connection allowed perception beyond conventional senses—awareness of patterns and possibilities that existed within the apparent chaos.

"The Order's understanding of the Wastes is fundamentally flawed," Wei observed as he moved through landscapes that transformed according to principles conventional physics couldn't accommodate. "They perceive disorder requiring correction rather than alternative order operating according to different principles."

"A perspective that serves their broader mission," Sutra explained. "The Order emerged after the cataclysm with mandate to prevent similar disasters through strict regulation of cultivation practices. Acknowledging alternative reality expressions would undermine their claim to definitive understanding of proper cultivation."

Wei considered this historical context as he established new position several kilometers from his previous location. The fluid reality zone extended throughout much of the northeastern Wastes, providing vast territory where his inverse cultivation could develop with natural environmental support.

"The hunters will maintain observation perimeter at the stable zone boundary," he assessed, creating temporary shelter through alignment of his Echo Chamber with local reality patterns. "Their specialized equipment can track general location but not precise position or activities within this level of distortion."

"Correct," Sutra confirmed. "This provides operational security sufficient for continued development. The Order's specialists will require preparation time before deployment—likely several days given the unusual nature of your case."

This timeline created opportunity for Wei to stabilize his current advancement before facing additional challenges. The manifestation stage he had achieved under pressure required refinement—transforming instinctive response into controlled technique that could be reliably applied in various circumstances.

He settled into meditation posture, focusing on the externalized Echo Chamber and its connection to his established meridian network. The hollowness within him had expanded beyond physical boundaries, creating resonance with surrounding reality that allowed mutual influence rather than mere adaptation.

"The second manifestation builds upon the first," Sutra instructed as Wei began this refinement process. "Where Echo Chamber externalization creates connection with environment, Void Step utilizes that connection for movement beyond conventional spatial limitations."

Wei directed his attention toward this concept, understanding it as natural progression of what he had already achieved. If reality itself operated according to principles that included emptiness as fundamental component, then navigating through that emptiness represented logical application of his developing capabilities.

"Conventional movement operates through displacement," Sutra explained. "Physical body travels from one position to another, occupying each intervening point along the way. Void Step inverts this approach—instead of moving through space, you allow space to move around you."

The concept seemed paradoxical when expressed in language, yet made perfect sense when experienced through the Echo Chamber's resonance. Wei could perceive how reality itself contained emptiness between its apparent solidity—void spaces that existed not as absence but as fundamental component of existence itself.

"Begin with small distance," Sutra advised. "Identify position within your perception range, establish resonance between your Echo Chamber and the emptiness at that location, then allow that resonance to supersede your current position."

Wei focused on point approximately three meters from his current location, extending his awareness through the externalized Echo Chamber to perceive the emptiness existing there. Rather than seeing this as separate from the emptiness within himself, he recognized fundamental connection—the same void expressed in different locations.

With this recognition established, he allowed his Echo Chamber's resonance to shift—not moving toward the target position but permitting the distinction between positions to dissolve temporarily. For brief moment, the emptiness within him and the emptiness at his target location existed as single expression rather than separate manifestations.

When the moment passed, Wei found himself seated at the position he had identified, the transition occurring without conventional movement. He had not traveled through intervening space but had temporarily existed at both positions simultaneously before resolving to the target location.

"Excellent," Sutra approved. "The Void Step manifests naturally from your Echo Chamber's externalization. Your inherent emptiness creates exceptional compatibility with this technique."

Wei repeated the process several times, gradually increasing distance while maintaining precise control over target position. Each iteration refined his understanding of the technique's principles and limitations. The Void Step required clear perception of target location, consumed spiritual energy proportional to distance covered, and temporarily disrupted other inverse techniques during transition moment.

"This capability fundamentally changes tactical considerations," he noted after completing several successful iterations. "Conventional containment methods rely on establishing perimeters that prevent physical escape. Void Step renders such approaches largely ineffective."

"Yes," Sutra confirmed. "Though the Order's specialists will anticipate this capability and deploy counter-measures specifically designed to disrupt spatial techniques. Their understanding of inverse cultivation includes comprehensive knowledge of its applications."

Wei integrated this warning into his tactical assessment. The Void Step represented significant advantage but not invulnerability. Like all techniques, it operated according to principles that could be countered by opponents with sufficient knowledge and preparation.

"The key lies in application rather than mere capability," he reasoned. "Unpredictable utilization of predictable techniques creates advantage even against prepared opposition."

Sutra's approval manifested again. "Precisely. The Forgotten Path's strength emerges not from overwhelming power but from approaching situations from perspectives opponents cannot easily anticipate. Conventional cultivation relies on direct application of superior force; inverse cultivation succeeds through indirect application of alternative principles."

Wei continued practicing the Void Step throughout the day, gradually increasing both distance and precision while carefully managing energy expenditure. By evening, he could reliably transition up to fifty meters with minimal preparation, though greater distances required more focused concentration and consumed proportionally more spiritual energy.

As night cycle approached—the concept of true darkness being somewhat irrelevant in region where light behaved according to alternative physics—Wei established more permanent shelter by aligning his Echo Chamber's resonance with local reality patterns. The resulting structure wasn't physical construction in conventional sense but stabilized zone where reality maintained consistent properties despite the surrounding chaos.

"Your development progresses remarkably well," Sutra observed as Wei prepared for rest cycle. "The Echo Chamber's externalization and Void Step manifestation would typically require months of dedicated practice. Your achievement of both within days suggests exceptional compatibility with the Forgotten Path."

Wei considered this assessment while establishing meditation posture for restorative rest. His rapid progression resulted from unique combination of factors—comprehensive knowledge from the Meridian Sphere, experienced guidance from Sutra, natural compatibility due to his lack of conventional spiritual roots, and environmental support from the Wastes' fluid reality zone.

"The Order's response will escalate proportionally to my development," he noted, considering strategic implications. "Their specialists will deploy with equipment and techniques specifically designed to counter what I've manifested."

"Yes," Sutra agreed. "But their response timeline provides opportunity. Each day of uninterrupted development increases your capabilities while their counter-measures remain fixed until deployment. The balance shifts gradually in your favor despite their superior resources."

Wei acknowledged this assessment while allowing his consciousness to drift toward restorative state. The confrontation with Hunter Captain Meiying and her team had provided valuable experience and accelerated his development beyond anticipated progression. The next encounter would likely prove more challenging but also more educational.

As sleep approached, Wei experienced moment of perfect clarity—understanding that the path he had chosen operated through continuous adaptation rather than fixed progression. Each challenge encountered, each opposition faced, each limitation discovered became opportunity for development rather than obstacle to overcome.

The Forgotten Path wasn't merely alternative cultivation method but fundamentally different way of engaging with reality itself. Where conventional approaches sought to impose practitioner's will upon the world, the inverse approach embraced the world's inherent emptiness and worked within its natural patterns.

In this recognition, Wei found confirmation of his choice. The invisible servant had discovered path perfectly suited to his nature—one that transformed apparent weakness into unique strength and revealed possibility where others saw only limitation.

What had been forgotten was indeed being remembered. And in that remembering, everything was changing—not merely for Wei Liang but potentially for cultivation world that had denied such possibilities for centuries.
