# Chapter 2: Whispers Beneath the Floorboards

The sect library after midnight was a different world—silent except for the occasional creak of ancient wood settling, dark save for thin ribbons of moonlight filtering through the high windows. Wei Liang moved through this darkness with practiced ease, his footsteps soundless on the polished floor. Eight years of nocturnal study had taught him every loose floorboard, every guard's patrol pattern, every blind spot in the library's security.

Tonight's objective lay in the northwest corner, in the section reserved for inner disciples—a text on void energy manifestations that might contain information relevant to the Shattered Wastes. Wei had overheard Elder Huifang mentioning it to a senior disciple that morning, and the expedition preparations made such knowledge more valuable than ever.

He slipped between towering shelves, the scent of aged paper and preservation incense filling his nostrils. Cultivation manuals, historical records, and philosophical treatises surrounded him—knowledge denied to those of his station but consumed hungrily during these forbidden hours. Wei had read more of the sect's restricted texts than many acknowledged disciples, building a patchwork education from stolen moments.

The inner disciples' section was separated by an ornate wooden screen depicting the sect's founding. Wei ducked beneath a loose panel he had discovered years ago, emerging into the restricted area. Moonlight illuminated the titles on nearby shelves, and he quickly located his target: "Void Phenomena and Spiritual Boundaries."

As he reached for the text, a soft voice broke the silence.

"I wondered when you'd come for that one."

Wei froze, then slowly turned. Seated at a reading table, barely visible in the shadows, was Yun Hua—the sect leader's daughter. A small spirit light hovered near her shoulder, its glow deliberately dimmed. She watched him with curious eyes, a half-smile playing at her lips.

Wei's mind raced through escape routes, explanations, excuses—all inadequate. Discovery meant punishment, possibly expulsion. Yet Yun Hua's posture was relaxed, her expression more intrigued than accusatory.

"You're Wei Liang, aren't you?" she asked, closing the book before her. "The herb collector."

He nodded once, wary. That she knew his name at all was surprising.

"I've watched you," she continued. "For months now. Always after midnight, always returning books exactly where you found them. Never taking notes—you memorize everything, don't you?"

Again, he nodded, unsure what else to do.

Yun Hua gestured to the chair across from her. "Sit. If you're going to read that text, you should know its context."

Wei hesitated, every instinct warning against this interaction. Yun Hua was not just any inner disciple—she was the sect leader's only child, a prodigy whose cultivation had already reached the seventh level of Qi Condensation. Her word could destroy him.

Yet she had clearly known about his nighttime studies for some time and had not reported him. Curiosity overcame caution, and Wei carefully took the offered seat, placing the book on the table between them.

"You have no spiritual roots," Yun Hua said, not a question but an observation. "Yet you study cultivation texts meant for inner disciples. Why?"

Wei remained silent, weighing his response. The truth seemed both dangerous and inadequate.

"You don't need to answer," she said after a moment. "I think I understand. Knowledge is its own form of power, isn't it? Even without the ability to cultivate conventionally."

"Yes," Wei said, his voice rough from disuse.

Yun Hua nodded, as if confirming a theory. "That text you've chosen—it's controversial. Elder Huifang keeps it restricted because it suggests conventional understanding of cultivation is incomplete."

Wei's interest sharpened. "Incomplete how?"

"It proposes that void energy isn't merely destructive or chaotic, as commonly taught. The author suggests it represents an alternative spiritual current—one that operates by different principles than standard cultivation."

This was exactly the kind of information Wei had been searching for—possibilities beyond the conventional paths closed to him by birth.

"You've volunteered for the Wastes expedition," Yun Hua continued. "Looking for something specific, aren't you?"

Wei met her gaze directly for the first time. "Why are you here? Now?"

She smiled, appreciating his deflection. "The same reason as you. Knowledge restricted even from me. My father believes certain texts are too dangerous for someone at my cultivation level."

"And this one?" Wei gestured to the book between them.

"Particularly this one. The author was eventually labeled a heretic by the Order of Sixfold Balance. His later works were destroyed." She leaned forward slightly. "But I think you and I both know that destruction of knowledge rarely succeeds completely."

The implication was clear—she suspected Wei had accessed other forbidden texts, perhaps even copies of the destroyed works she mentioned. He had not, but the possibility that such texts existed somewhere in the sect was tantalizing.

"The Wastes expedition," Yun Hua said, changing direction, "is more significant than most disciples realize. The void fluctuations have increased dramatically in the past year. The Order is concerned."

"Why tell me this?" Wei asked.

"Because you're going there, and you're looking for something beyond herbs." She opened the book between them, turning to a diagram showing energy flows. "And because I think you, without preconceptions about cultivation, might see things others miss."

Wei studied the diagram—it showed conventional spiritual energy as flowing in established patterns, while void energy moved in reverse currents, consuming rather than building. The text beside it described void phenomena as "inversions of established principles" rather than simply chaotic disruptions.

"The expedition leaves in three days," Yun Hua said. "Elder Huifang has selected Feng Zhao to lead the disciples."

Wei controlled his expression, but internally he grimaced. Feng Zhao was known for his cruelty toward servant disciples, taking particular pleasure in assigning them impossible tasks and then administering punishment for failure.

"He requested you specifically," Yun Hua added, watching Wei's reaction. "Claimed your herb knowledge would be valuable."

This was unexpected and concerning. Wei had assumed his selection would go unnoticed by the inner disciples. That Feng Zhao had not only noticed but requested him suggested ulterior motives.

"Be careful around him," Yun Hua said, confirming Wei's suspicions. "Feng Zhao doesn't value knowledge for its own sake. He seeks power, nothing more."

"Why warn me?" Wei asked, genuinely puzzled by her apparent concern.

Yun Hua was silent for a moment, considering her answer. "Because the sect wastes too much potential already. Because knowledge should be accessible to those who truly value it." She paused. "And because I'm curious what someone like you might discover, approaching cultivation from outside traditional limitations."

She was using him as an experiment, Wei realized. Yet her interest, however academic, offered protection and access he wouldn't otherwise have.

"Study this tonight," she said, pushing the book toward him. "I've made arrangements with the night patrol—we won't be disturbed."

Wei raised an eyebrow at this revelation of her influence.

"Being the sect leader's daughter has some advantages," she said with a small smile. "Though fewer than you might imagine."

For the next two hours, they read in companionable silence, occasionally exchanging observations. Yun Hua's knowledge of cultivation theory was comprehensive, her insights sharp. Wei found himself speaking more than he had in years, drawn out by her genuine interest in his perspective.

The text described void energy as "memory-reactive"—responding to and consuming spiritual impressions rather than physical matter. This property made it particularly dangerous to cultivators, whose bodies and spirits were saturated with energy patterns established through years of practice.

"That's why the Wastes are so dangerous for high-level cultivators," Yun Hua mused. "Their very advancement makes them more vulnerable to void disruption."

"While someone without cultivation..." Wei began.

"Might pass through relatively unaffected," she finished. "At least theoretically. Though the physical dangers remain significant."

Wei considered this. If void energy truly operated on inverse principles, then conventional cultivation weaknesses might become strengths, and vice versa. The rootless, worthless in traditional cultivation, might have unique advantages in void-touched environments.

"You're thinking of trying something in the Wastes," Yun Hua said, reading his expression. "Something dangerous."

Wei didn't deny it. "Knowledge without application is incomplete."

She studied him for a long moment. "There's a storage room behind the east meditation hall. The lock is broken, though few know it. I'll leave something there for you tomorrow—a token that might prove useful in the Wastes."

Before Wei could question this unexpected offer, she rose. "Dawn approaches. You should return that book exactly where you found it and get some rest before morning duties."

Wei nodded, closing the text carefully. "Thank you," he said, the words feeling inadequate for the risk she had taken in speaking with him.

"Don't thank me yet," Yun Hua replied. "If you succeed in whatever you're planning, remember that knowledge is meant to be preserved, not hoarded." With that cryptic statement, she extinguished her spirit light and disappeared into the shadows of the library.

Wei replaced the book precisely as he had found it and made his way back through the loose panel in the screen. As he navigated the darkened library toward the exit, his mind buzzed with new possibilities. Void energy as an inverse current rather than mere chaos. Memory-reactive properties that might be manipulated. The potential advantages of approaching such energy without preexisting cultivation patterns.

And beneath these thoughts, a deeper question: Why had Yun Hua really sought him out? Her stated curiosity seemed genuine, but incomplete as motivation for such risk. The sect leader's daughter had little to gain and much to lose by associating with a servant disciple breaking fundamental rules.

Unless she too sought something beyond conventional cultivation paths. Unless she recognized in Wei a potential that others had dismissed.

Dawn was breaking as Wei slipped back into his small room. In just a few hours, he would need to begin his daily duties, but his mind was too active for sleep. He knelt beside his chest and removed his hidden texts, comparing what he had just learned with his previous research.

Patterns emerged, connections formed. The Shattered Wastes, created during the cataclysm that ended the Forgotten Age. Void energy that inverted conventional spiritual principles. Memory as a form of spiritual currency, consumed rather than accumulated.

And somewhere in the Wastes, perhaps, a path to power for someone born without spiritual roots—a forgotten path that operated by different rules than those that had deemed him worthless at birth.

Wei finally lay down on his sleeping mat as the first rays of sunlight filtered through his small window. Tomorrow he would find whatever Yun Hua intended to leave for him. In three days, he would depart for the Shattered Wastes with the expedition.

And there, perhaps, he would discover whether knowledge alone could truly become power—or if he was merely chasing shadows and whispers, like so many desperate rootless before him.
