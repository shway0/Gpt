# Chapter 2: Whispers Beneath the Floorboards

The sect library after midnight was a different world—silent except for the occasional creak of ancient wood settling, dark save for thin ribbons of moonlight filtering through the high windows. Wei Liang pressed himself against the wall as a night patrol guard passed, holding his breath until the footsteps faded. Eight years of nocturnal study had taught him every loose floorboard, every guard's patrol pattern, every blind spot in the library's security.

Tonight was different. After his confrontation with Dao, security had been heightened—someone had reported unusual activity in the restricted sections. Wei had nearly turned back twice already after narrowly avoiding detection.

His objective lay in the northwest corner, in the section reserved for inner disciples—a text on void energy manifestations that might contain information relevant to the Shattered Wastes. Wei had overheard Elder Huifang mentioning it to a senior disciple that morning, and with the expedition only days away, such knowledge was more valuable than ever.

A floorboard creaked beneath his foot, the sound impossibly loud in the silence. Wei froze, listening intently. Footsteps approached—a guard changing route. Wei slipped behind a bookshelf, pressing himself into the narrow space as a guard passed, spirit light illuminating the aisle he'd occupied seconds before.

"Someone's been in here," the guard muttered, examining the floor. "Dust disturbed."

Wei held his breath, calculating escape routes. The window behind him was too small. The main entrance was now blocked. That left only the service door used by library attendants—across an open space the guard would surely see.

The guard moved closer to Wei's hiding spot, spirit light growing brighter. "Show yourself," he commanded. "Unauthorized presence in the library is punishable by—"

A crash sounded from the opposite side of the library. The guard spun, rushing toward the noise. Wei didn't hesitate—he darted from his hiding place, moving silently toward the northwest corner. Whatever had caused the distraction wouldn't occupy the guard for long.

He slipped between towering shelves, the scent of aged paper and preservation incense filling his nostrils. Cultivation manuals, historical records, and philosophical treatises surrounded him—knowledge denied to those of his station but consumed hungrily during these forbidden hours.

The inner disciples' section was separated by an ornate wooden screen depicting the sect's founding. Wei ducked beneath a loose panel he had discovered years ago, emerging into the restricted area. Moonlight illuminated the titles on nearby shelves, and he quickly located his target: "Void Phenomena and Spiritual Boundaries."

As he reached for the text, a soft voice broke the silence.

"I wondered when you'd come for that one."

Wei spun around, dropping into a defensive crouch. Seated at a reading table, barely visible in the shadows, was Yun Hua—the sect leader's daughter. A small spirit light hovered near her shoulder, its glow deliberately dimmed. She watched him with curious eyes, a half-smile playing at her lips.

"You caused the distraction," Wei said, realization dawning.

"The guard will return shortly," she replied, ignoring his statement. "You have perhaps five minutes before he completes his search."

Wei's mind raced through escape routes, explanations, excuses—all inadequate. Discovery meant punishment, possibly expulsion. Yet Yun Hua's posture was relaxed, her expression more intrigued than accusatory.

"You're Wei Liang, aren't you?" she asked, closing the book before her. "The herb collector. The one Feng Zhao specifically requested for the expedition."

He nodded once, wary. That she knew his name at all was surprising. That she knew about Feng Zhao's request was alarming.

"I've watched you," she continued. "For months now. Always after midnight, always returning books exactly where you found them. Never taking notes—you memorize everything, don't you?"

Again, he nodded, unsure what else to do.

"Why are you here?" Wei asked, remaining near the exit. "Surely the sect leader's daughter doesn't need to sneak into the library."

"Don't I?" Her eyes hardened slightly. "Being the sect leader's daughter means more restrictions, not fewer. Certain knowledge is deemed... inappropriate for me."

Yun Hua gestured to the chair across from her. "Sit. If you're going to read that text, you should know its context. And we don't have much time."

Wei hesitated, every instinct warning against this interaction. Yun Hua was not just any inner disciple—she was the sect leader's only child, a prodigy whose cultivation had already reached the seventh level of Qi Condensation. Her word could destroy him.

Yet she had clearly known about his nighttime studies for some time and had not reported him. More importantly, she had created a distraction to help him evade the guard. Curiosity overcame caution, and Wei carefully took the offered seat, placing the book on the table between them.

"You have no spiritual roots," Yun Hua said, not a question but an observation. "Yet you study cultivation texts meant for inner disciples. You volunteer for a dangerous expedition to the Wastes. Why?"

Wei remained silent, weighing his response. The truth seemed both dangerous and inadequate.

"You seek power," she said after a moment, leaning forward. "Not influence or status—actual cultivation power. You believe there's a way for the rootless to cultivate."

Wei's eyes narrowed. "And if I do?"

"Then you're either delusional or brilliant," she said bluntly. "The Order of Sixfold Balance has spent centuries establishing that spiritual roots are essential for cultivation. Thousands of rootless have died trying to prove otherwise."

"Yet you're here, talking to me instead of reporting me," Wei observed. "Why?"

Yun Hua opened the book between them, turning to a diagram showing energy flows. "Because conventional understanding of cultivation is incomplete. This text suggests void energy isn't merely destructive or chaotic, as commonly taught. The author proposes it represents an alternative spiritual current—one that operates by different principles than standard cultivation."

Wei studied the diagram—it showed conventional spiritual energy as flowing in established patterns, while void energy moved in reverse currents, consuming rather than building. The text beside it described void phenomena as "inversions of established principles" rather than simply chaotic disruptions.

"The author was eventually labeled a heretic by the Order," Yun Hua continued. "His later works were destroyed." She leaned forward slightly. "But I think you and I both know that destruction of knowledge rarely succeeds completely."

The implication was clear—she suspected Wei had accessed other forbidden texts, perhaps even copies of the destroyed works she mentioned. He had not, but the possibility that such texts existed somewhere in the sect was tantalizing.

Footsteps sounded in the distance—the guard returning.

"We don't have much time," Yun Hua said, her voice dropping lower. "The Wastes expedition is more significant than most disciples realize. The void fluctuations have increased dramatically in the past year. The Order is concerned."

"Why tell me this?" Wei asked.

"Because you're going there, and you're looking for something beyond herbs." She tapped the diagram. "And because I think you, without preconceptions about cultivation, might see things others miss."

The footsteps grew louder.

"Feng Zhao requested you specifically," Yun Hua added, watching Wei's reaction. "Claimed your herb knowledge would be valuable."

This was unexpected and concerning. Wei had assumed his selection would go unnoticed by the inner disciples. That Feng Zhao had not only noticed but requested him suggested ulterior motives.

"He knows about your nighttime studies," she said, confirming Wei's worst fears. "He's been watching you for weeks."

Wei's blood ran cold. "How do you know this?"

"Because I've been watching him watch you," she replied. "Feng Zhao doesn't value knowledge for its own sake. He seeks power, nothing more. And he believes you've found something valuable."

The guard's footsteps stopped just outside the inner disciples' section. The ornate screen wouldn't hide them if he decided to check inside.

"Trust no one on the expedition," Yun Hua whispered urgently. "Especially not Feng Zhao."

"Why are you helping me?" Wei asked, genuinely puzzled by her apparent concern.

Yun Hua was silent for a moment, considering her answer. "Because the sect wastes too much potential already. Because knowledge should be accessible to those who truly value it." She paused. "And because I'm curious what someone like you might discover, approaching cultivation from outside traditional limitations."

She was using him as an experiment, Wei realized. Yet her interest, however academic, offered protection and access he wouldn't otherwise have.

The guard's footsteps resumed, moving away from their location.

"We need to leave," Yun Hua said, standing. "Separately. Take the book—I've already read it thoroughly."

Wei hesitated. "Taking it will be noticed."

"Not if something else goes missing instead." She reached into her robes and withdrew a jade cultivation token—her own, by the insignia. "This will be discovered missing tomorrow. The library will be searched, but the book's absence won't be the focus."

"You'd risk your token?" Wei asked, incredulous. Such items were precious, containing years of accumulated spiritual energy.

"It's a calculated risk," she replied. "My father will assume I've misplaced it. The search will find nothing. And in the confusion, no one will notice one missing text from the restricted section."

Wei took the book, concealing it within his robes. "I can't repay this."

"You already are," she said cryptically. "There's a storage room behind the east meditation hall. The lock is broken, though few know it. I'll leave something there for you tomorrow—a token that might prove useful in the Wastes."

Before Wei could question this unexpected offer, she moved toward the screen. "Wait three minutes, then leave through the service entrance. The guard will be at the east wing by then."

Wei nodded, but as Yun Hua reached the screen, voices sounded from beyond—multiple guards, approaching quickly.

"Someone else is here," she whispered, returning to Wei's side. "This wasn't part of the plan."

Wei's mind raced. The voices grew louder—at least three guards, discussing a reported intruder. They were trapped.

"Your spirit light," Wei said suddenly. "Can you make it brighter? Much brighter?"

Yun Hua nodded, understanding immediately. "Cover your eyes."

Wei shielded his face as Yun Hua's spirit light flared brilliantly, illuminating the entire section with blinding intensity. Shouts of surprise came from beyond the screen as the guards were momentarily blinded.

"Now!" Wei grabbed Yun Hua's arm, pulling her toward a window he'd noticed earlier—too small for comfort, but their only option. He pushed aside the lattice covering and helped her through first, then squeezed through himself, dropping to the ground outside just as guards burst into the inner disciples' section.

They pressed against the wall beneath the window, breathing heavily as guards shouted inside, calling for reinforcements.

"The east gardens," Yun Hua whispered. "We can circle back to the residential area from there."

They moved silently through the darkness, using hedges and statues for cover as more guards emerged from the library, spirit lights scanning the grounds. At the edge of the formal gardens, they paused.

"We should separate here," Yun Hua said. "You go first. I'll create another distraction."

Wei nodded, but before he could move, she gripped his arm.

"Remember what I said about Feng Zhao," she warned. "And about the storage room. Tomorrow, after the evening meal."

"Why risk all this?" Wei asked again. "Your position, your cultivation token, your safety—all for knowledge you've already acquired?"

Yun Hua's expression grew serious. "Because there are forces in the sect working against certain types of knowledge being preserved. Forces that would rather see texts like that one destroyed." She nodded toward the book concealed in his robes. "And because I believe the Wastes hold answers that the Order of Sixfold Balance doesn't want found."

With that, she stepped into the open and deliberately knocked over a decorative vase. As guards rushed toward the sound, Wei slipped away in the opposite direction, the stolen text pressed against his chest.

Dawn was breaking as Wei finally returned to his small room, heart still pounding from the night's events. In just a few hours, he would need to begin his daily duties, but his mind was too active for sleep. He knelt beside his chest and carefully concealed the stolen text among his other hidden materials.

The night's revelations tumbled through his thoughts. Void energy as an inverse current rather than mere chaos. Memory-reactive properties that might be manipulated. The potential advantages of approaching such energy without preexisting cultivation patterns.

And more immediate concerns: Feng Zhao had been watching him. Knew about his forbidden studies. Had specifically requested him for the expedition. None of this boded well.

A soft knock at his door froze Wei in place. He quickly closed his chest, ensuring the hidden compartment was secure before opening the door a crack.

Yanmei stood outside, her expression tense. "The sect is in uproar," she whispered. "Guards everywhere. They're saying someone broke into the restricted section of the library."

Wei kept his face neutral. "Why tell me?"

"Because three servant disciples have already been questioned," she replied. "Including Dao. And he mentioned your name."

Wei's stomach tightened. "What did he say?"

"That you've been sneaking around at night. That you have forbidden knowledge." She glanced nervously down the corridor. "They're searching servants' quarters. I thought you should know."

Before Wei could respond, shouts echoed from the far end of the corridor. Guards, moving from room to room.

"They're coming," Yanmei said urgently. "If you have anything to hide—"

Wei made a split-second decision. "Help me," he said, pulling her inside and closing the door. He quickly retrieved the stolen text from his chest and looked around desperately for a hiding place.

Yanmei's eyes widened at the sight of the book. "Is that—"

"No time," Wei cut her off. "Where can I hide this? They'll search everything."

Yanmei hesitated only briefly before lifting her outer robe, revealing a hidden pocket sewn into the lining. "Give it to me. They rarely search female servants thoroughly."

Wei handed her the text, which she quickly concealed within her robe. "Why help me?" he asked as the shouts grew closer.

"Because we made a deal," she replied simply. "We watch each other's backs, remember?"

The voices were just outside now. Yanmei moved toward the door. "Act normal. Deny everything. I'll return the book when it's safe."

As she slipped out, Wei quickly rearranged his few possessions to hide any evidence of his secret studies. The guards would find his hidden compartment if they searched thoroughly enough, but without the stolen text, they would have no proof of tonight's transgression.

He sat on his sleeping mat, forcing his breathing to slow, his expression to calm. In three days, he would depart for the Shattered Wastes with the expedition. Until then, he needed to survive the sect's investigation, retrieve the hidden text, and discover what Yun Hua intended to leave for him in the storage room.

And somehow, he needed to prepare for whatever Feng Zhao had planned for him in the Wastes.

The door burst open as two guards entered, spirit lights blazing. "You," one commanded, pointing at Wei. "On your feet. Elder Huifang wants to speak with you."

Wei rose slowly, his face a careful mask of confusion and deference. The game had changed, the stakes raised. No longer was he merely seeking knowledge in secret—now he was caught in currents of sect politics and power he barely understood.

But for the first time in his life, Wei Liang wasn't merely reacting to events around him. He was making choices, taking risks, pursuing a path of his own determination.

As the guards escorted him from his room, Wei's mind was already calculating his next moves. The storage room behind the east meditation hall. The expedition in three days. And somewhere in the Shattered Wastes, perhaps, a power that operated by different rules than those that had deemed him worthless at birth.

Rules he was now determined to discover, whatever the cost.
