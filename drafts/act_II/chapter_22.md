# Chapter 22: Ru Yun's Past

The night passed slowly as Ru Yun maintained her vigil over the unconscious Wei Liang. His condition remained stable—the violet glow of his restructured meridians pulsing with steady rhythm, the crystalline patterns beneath his skin neither advancing nor receding. The diagnostic formation beneath his pallet continued to project images of his internal energy flows, providing data that Ru Yun meticulously recorded in her research journal.

Dawn brought no change, and Ru Yun finally allowed herself a brief rest. She settled into a meditation posture near the shelter entrance, positioned to detect any approach while maintaining awareness of her patient's condition. As her consciousness settled into the familiar rhythm of cultivation practice, memories rose unbidden—not the organized recollections of deliberate review, but the jagged fragments of trauma that time had failed to smooth.

Five years earlier...

The Crimson Cloud Sect's library annex glowed with soft illumination as Ru Yun carefully transcribed ancient text from a crumbling scroll to preservation paper. At twenty-two, she had already earned recognition as one of the sect's most promising scholars, her talent for theoretical cultivation mechanics matched only by her dedication to knowledge preservation.

"Still working, Junior Sister?" The voice came from the doorway, where Lin Mei stood with an amused expression. Though only ten years Ru Yun's senior, Lin Mei had achieved the position of Research Elder through brilliance that even the sect's conservative leadership couldn't ignore.

"Elder Lin." Ru Yun rose respectfully. "I'm nearly finished with the Meridian Harmonization Scrolls. The preservation technique you developed has made it possible to recover sections previously thought lost."

Lin Mei approached, examining Ru Yun's work with approval. "Excellent. And have you found anything interesting in those recovered sections?"

Ru Yun hesitated. Lin Mei's question seemed casual, but nothing about the Research Elder was ever truly casual. Every inquiry had purpose, every conversation layers of meaning.

"The author describes cultivation approaches that don't align with current sect doctrine," Ru Yun said carefully. "Techniques for channeling energies that the Order classifies as void-adjacent, but which the author categorizes differently."

Lin Mei's expression revealed nothing, but her eyes sharpened with interest. "And what do you make of these techniques, Junior Sister?"

This was a test—one with potentially serious consequences. The Order of Sixfold Balance maintained strict control over cultivation methodology throughout the known world. Techniques that deviated from established doctrine were classified as corrupted, their practitioners hunted and "cleansed." Even theoretical discussion of alternative approaches could bring unwanted attention.

"I think," Ru Yun said slowly, "that our understanding of cultivation energies may be more limited than the Order acknowledges. These scrolls predate the Cataclysm by centuries, yet describe energy manipulation with greater precision than many current texts."

Lin Mei smiled, a quick expression that vanished as quickly as it appeared. "Finish your transcription, then come to my private research chamber. There's something I'd like to show you."

Later that night, in a chamber protected by multiple layers of concealment formations, Lin Mei revealed her true work—research into alternative cultivation approaches that challenged the Order's rigid categorization of energies. Her private library contained texts that would have resulted in immediate execution if discovered, her laboratory equipment modifications that bypassed standard energy detection methods.

"The Order's sixfold classification system is artificial," Lin Mei explained, showing Ru Yun diagrams that depicted energy flows as a continuous spectrum rather than discrete categories. "It was implemented after the Cataclysm to establish control, not because it represents natural reality."

"But the corruption risks—" Ru Yun began.

"Are real," Lin Mei acknowledged, "but manageable through proper technique. What the Order calls 'void corruption' is simply imbalance—the result of improper integration, not an inherent quality of the energies themselves."

That night marked the beginning of Ru Yun's true education—an apprenticeship conducted in secret, parallel to her official studies. For two years, she assisted Lin Mei's research, helping document alternative cultivation approaches and testing theoretical models that suggested possibilities beyond the Order's rigid framework.

Their work remained undetected until a routine inspection by Order representatives took an unexpected turn. An equipment malfunction in Lin Mei's official laboratory revealed traces of their private research—not enough to prove deliberate heresy, but sufficient to trigger deeper investigation.

Ru Yun was in the sect's main library when the attack began. The distinctive hum of Order enforcement skimmers filled the air, followed by the sharp crack of barrier formations being systematically dismantled. She rushed to the window in time to see white-robed Order enforcers deploying throughout the sect grounds, their movements coordinated with mechanical precision.

This was no inspection—it was a purge.

Ru Yun's first thought was for the research. If the Order discovered Lin Mei's private chamber, years of irreplaceable work would be destroyed. She moved quickly through back corridors, using her knowledge of the sect's layout to avoid the main confrontation points where sect elders were already engaging the enforcers.

The research wing was eerily quiet when she arrived, most personnel having responded to the sect's defense call. Ru Yun slipped into Lin Mei's official laboratory and found it ransacked, equipment shattered and documents scattered. A trail of destruction led toward the concealed entrance to the private research chamber.

The hidden door stood open, its protective formations disabled. Inside, Lin Mei was systematically destroying sensitive materials, her movements calm despite the chaos beyond the walls.

"Elder Lin!" Ru Yun called.

Lin Mei looked up, her expression shifting from determination to concern. "Ru Yun! You shouldn't be here. The Order has declared full cleansing protocol—they're not taking prisoners."

"We need to evacuate the research," Ru Yun insisted, already moving to help. "Your work is too important to lose."

"Most of it is already gone," Lin Mei said, indicating the ashes in a specialized burning basin that left no energy residue. "But you're right about one thing." She removed a jade pendant from around her neck and pressed it into Ru Yun's hand. "This contains core theoretical frameworks and experimental results. It's encoded—only someone with appropriate knowledge could access it."

Ru Yun clutched the pendant, feeling its subtle energy signature. "What about you? We need to leave now."

Lin Mei shook her head. "I can't. The sect leadership is fighting because of me—because the Order discovered my research. I won't compound their sacrifice by running."

"That's illogical," Ru Yun argued, her scholar's mind rejecting the emotional reasoning. "Your death serves no purpose if your research is lost."

"My research isn't lost," Lin Mei said, looking pointedly at the pendant in Ru Yun's hand. "It's being preserved through you. Now go—take the emergency exit tunnel. It leads to the eastern forest."

The building shook as a powerful cultivation technique impacted nearby. Dust filtered down from the ceiling, and the distinctive sound of Order purification techniques became audible—a high-pitched whine that preceded energy sterilization.

"They're getting closer," Lin Mei said. "You need to leave now."

Ru Yun hesitated, torn between loyalty and logic. "Elder Lin—"

"That's an order, Junior Sister," Lin Mei said firmly. "Someone must survive to continue the work. Someone must remember what they tried to erase."

Another impact, closer this time. The laboratory's remaining equipment rattled on shelves.

"Go through the records room," Lin Mei instructed, pushing Ru Yun toward a side door. "Take anything you can carry that might be useful. The tunnel entrance is behind the third bookcase."

Ru Yun moved reluctantly, looking back one last time. Lin Mei had returned to her methodical destruction of research materials, her posture straight, her movements precise even in this moment of crisis.

"Elder Lin," Ru Yun called, "I'll preserve your work. I promise."

Lin Mei looked up, a genuine smile breaking through her composed exterior. "I know you will. Now run, clever girl. Run and remember."

The records room was already partially damaged, smoke seeping through cracks in the wall that separated it from adjacent chambers. Ru Yun moved quickly, selecting the most valuable materials—research journals, experimental data, theoretical frameworks that existed nowhere else. She stuffed them into a reinforced bag, along with cultivation tools that would be difficult to replace.

The tunnel entrance was where Lin Mei had indicated, concealed behind a bookcase that swung outward when the correct pressure was applied. Ru Yun had just started to enter when a massive explosion rocked the building. The ceiling collapsed partially, blocking half the tunnel entrance. Through the gap in the wall created by the explosion, Ru Yun caught a glimpse of the main laboratory.

Lin Mei stood surrounded by Order enforcers, their white robes immaculate despite the destruction around them. At their center was a figure in crimson and gold—a high-ranking Order Purifier, his face serene as he pronounced judgment.

"Lin Mei of Crimson Cloud Sect, you are found guilty of cultivation heresy, knowledge corruption, and violation of Order doctrine. The sentence is purification."

Lin Mei stood straight, her hands empty at her sides. "Your Order is built on lies. What you call corruption is simply knowledge you fear."

The Purifier made a simple gesture. "Your delusion persists to the end. Commence purification."

The enforcers moved in perfect unison, their cultivation techniques converging on Lin Mei from all directions. She made no attempt to defend herself, but as the techniques struck, she looked directly toward the partially collapsed wall—directly at Ru Yun's hiding place. Her lips moved, forming words that Ru Yun couldn't hear but could read: "Remember and continue."

Then the purification techniques engulfed her completely, a blinding flash that forced Ru Yun to shield her eyes. When the light faded, nothing remained of Lin Mei but a scorch mark on the laboratory floor.

Ru Yun bit back a cry and forced herself to move, crawling through the partially collapsed tunnel as sounds of fighting intensified behind her. The tunnel extended for nearly a kilometer, emerging in a dense forest east of the sect grounds. When Ru Yun finally emerged, gasping for fresh air, the night sky was illuminated by the burning buildings of Crimson Cloud Sect.

From her vantage point, she could see Order skimmers circling the compound, methodically targeting any structures still standing. There would be no survivors—the Order's cleansing protocol was thorough when dealing with what they termed "knowledge corruption."

Ru Yun clutched the jade pendant that contained Lin Mei's research and made a silent vow. She would preserve this knowledge, would continue the work, would find a way to prove that the Order's rigid doctrine was unnecessary limitation rather than protection. But first, she needed to survive—to disappear so completely that the Order would never connect her to Lin Mei's research.

That night, Ru Yun the promising scholar died alongside Crimson Cloud Sect. In her place emerged someone new—a survivor with a single purpose, moving silently through the darkness away from everything she had known.

The memory faded as Ru Yun opened her eyes, returning to the present moment in her hidden shelter. Five years had passed since that night. Five years of careful movement through the cultivation world's shadows, gathering resources and information while maintaining a profile too insignificant to attract the Order's attention.

She looked at the unconscious Wei Liang, his meridians still glowing with that impossible violet light. If her preliminary assessment was correct, he had achieved what Lin Mei had only theorized—true integration of energies the Order insisted must remain separate. His existence was living proof that the foundation of the Order's power was built on false premises.

"You would have been fascinated by him, Elder Lin," Ru Yun murmured.

A subtle change in Wei's condition drew her attention. The rhythm of his meridian pulses had shifted, becoming slightly faster and more regular. The diagnostic formation showed increased activity in his core, suggesting he might be approaching consciousness.

Ru Yun moved quickly, preparing for multiple contingencies. She placed protective talismans at strategic points around the shelter, positioned herself where she could observe without being immediately visible, and readied both defensive and restraint techniques. If Wei woke disoriented or hostile, she needed to be prepared to protect both him and herself.

As she completed these preparations, Ru Yun reflected on the parallels between her current situation and that night five years ago. Once again, she was preserving knowledge the Order would destroy without hesitation. Once again, she was making decisions that placed her in direct opposition to the most powerful organization in the cultivation world.

But this time was different in one crucial aspect—Wei Liang represented not just theoretical possibility but practical implementation. If she could help him recover, understand how he had achieved this transformation, perhaps even replicate aspects of it...

The implications were revolutionary. Not just for cultivation theory but for the power structures that governed the entire cultivation world. The Order maintained control through monopoly on approved cultivation methods. If alternatives became viable, that monopoly would crumble.

Wei's meridian glow intensified briefly, then stabilized at a brighter level. His breathing deepened, and his fingers twitched slightly—the first voluntary movement since she had found him.

"Remember and continue," Ru Yun whispered, echoing Lin Mei's final instruction as she prepared to face whatever awakened from Wei Liang's unprecedented transformation.

The past had brought her to this moment—had shaped her into someone capable of recognizing the significance of what lay before her. Now she needed to ensure that both she and Wei survived long enough to build a future where such knowledge wouldn't require hiding in the shadows.

Ru Yun checked her defensive preparations one final time and settled in to wait, her attention fixed on the diagnostic formation's projection as Wei Liang's consciousness slowly, inexorably began its return to the surface.

---

Three days after fleeing Crimson Cloud Sect, Ru Yun reached the border town of Mist Harbor—a place known for asking few questions of those willing to pay for discretion. Her sect robes had been discarded, replaced by nondescript traveling clothes purchased from a roadside vendor. The jade pendant containing Lin Mei's research hung on a simple cord beneath her clothing, its energy signature muted by concealment techniques.

Ru Yun's immediate needs were practical—secure lodging, supplies for continued travel, and information about Order movements in the region. She had limited funds—just enough spirit stones to sustain her for perhaps a month if she was frugal. After that, she would need to find alternative resources.

The inn she selected was unremarkable, its clientele a mix of merchants, travelers, and others who preferred minimal attention. Ru Yun paid for a small room at the back, then made her way to the common area where conversations might yield useful information.

She selected a corner table, ordered a simple meal, and listened to the ambient discussions. Most were mundane—trade conditions, local gossip, complaints about weather affecting travel. Then a group of merchants at a nearby table lowered their voices, their manner suddenly cautious.

"Heard about Crimson Cloud?" one asked.

"Complete purification," another replied. "Order's saying knowledge corruption at the highest levels."

"Third sect this year," a third merchant noted. "Order's getting more aggressive with these purges."

"Can you blame them?" the first merchant countered. "After what happened in the Northern Reaches? That void outbreak destroyed three villages before they contained it."

Ru Yun maintained a neutral expression while straining to hear more details. This was the first she'd heard of any void outbreak in the Northern Reaches.

"Still," the second merchant said, "purifying entire sects seems extreme. There were over three hundred disciples at Crimson Cloud. Hard to believe they were all corrupted."

"Order doesn't take chances with void contamination," the first merchant insisted. "Better to purify thoroughly than risk spread."

The conversation shifted to other topics, but Ru Yun had heard enough to understand the official narrative. The Order had classified Crimson Cloud's destruction as a purification response to knowledge corruption—their standard justification for eliminating those who challenged their authority. More concerning was the reference to a void outbreak in the Northern Reaches, which might explain the Order's increased aggression.

As Ru Yun finished her meal, a new patron entered the inn—a woman whose careful movements and observant gaze marked her as more than a casual traveler. She wore the simple clothes of a border scout, but the quality of her equipment and the subtle cultivation technique she used to scan the room suggested more specialized training.

The woman's gaze passed over Ru Yun without lingering, but instinct warned that dismissal might be deliberate rather than genuine. Ru Yun waited until the woman had settled at the bar before casually rising and returning to her room. There, she quickly gathered her few possessions, preparing for immediate departure if necessary.

A soft knock at her door confirmed her suspicions. Ru Yun positioned herself beside the door rather than in front of it, a defensive technique ingrained through years of training.

"Yes?" she called.

"Room inspection," came the reply. "Inn policy."

A transparent lie—the establishment clearly prided itself on minimal interference with guests. Ru Yun reached for a defensive talisman, ready to activate it at the first sign of hostility.

"One moment," she said, using the delay to activate a concealment technique that would mask the jade pendant's energy signature more thoroughly.

When she opened the door, the border scout stood waiting, her posture relaxed but ready. Up close, Ru Yun could see the faint scar along her jawline—a distinctive mark mentioned in descriptions of Order auxiliary operatives.

"Can I help you?" Ru Yun asked, maintaining her role as an unremarkable traveler.

The woman studied her with practiced assessment. "Perhaps. I'm looking for survivors from Crimson Cloud Sect. There's reason to believe some escaped before purification was complete."

Direct confrontation—unexpected and concerning. Order operatives typically used more subtle approaches when tracking fugitives. This directness suggested either confidence or desperation.

"Crimson Cloud?" Ru Yun feigned confusion. "I've heard merchants mention something happening there, but I know little about sect matters."

"Really?" The woman leaned against the doorframe, blocking the exit. "Because your cultivation signature shows traces of Crimson Cloud's distinctive meditation technique. Faint, but present to those who know what to look for."

A serious oversight—Ru Yun had changed her clothes and concealed her possessions, but hadn't considered that her basic cultivation patterns might identify her sect origin. Lin Mei had warned about this possibility, had stressed the importance of modifying base cultivation patterns when hiding from the Order.

"I trained briefly at several sects in my youth," Ru Yun improvised. "Crimson Cloud may have been among them, though I completed my formal education elsewhere."

"And where was that?" the woman pressed.

"Eastern Summit Academy," Ru Yun replied, naming a minor institution known for accepting students from various backgrounds without strict doctrinal requirements.

The woman's expression revealed nothing, but her hand shifted slightly toward a concealed weapon. "Eastern Summit closed eight years ago following financial mismanagement. Try again, Crimson Cloud disciple."

The situation had deteriorated beyond recovery. This operative had confirmed Ru Yun's identity and was now simply toying with her, perhaps hoping to extract information about other survivors before making an arrest—or worse, conducting field purification.

Ru Yun made her decision in an instant. She activated the defensive talisman, creating a momentary energy barrier between herself and the operative. In the same motion, she drove her palm toward the woman's solar plexus, channeling a precise cultivation technique designed to temporarily disrupt meridian function.

The operative was fast, partially evading the strike, but Ru Yun's technique still connected with sufficient force to send her staggering backward. Ru Yun used this moment to grab her prepared travel pack and dash past the disoriented woman, heading not for the inn's main exit but for the window at the end of the hallway.

Behind her, the operative recovered quickly, shouting, "Order business! Fugitive from Crimson Cloud!"

Ru Yun didn't look back. She crashed through the window, using a minor cultivation technique to reduce the impact as she landed in the alley below. Without pausing, she sprinted toward the town's eastern gate, knowing her only chance was to reach the dense forest beyond before reinforcements could be mobilized.

The operative's warning had roused others—Ru Yun glimpsed white-robed figures converging from multiple directions as she weaved through back alleys. The Order maintained cells of enforcers in most border towns, ready to respond to void manifestations or, in this case, fugitives from purification operations.

Ru Yun reached the town wall at a section away from the main gate, where the stonework showed signs of recent repair. Using cultivation techniques to enhance her physical abilities, she scaled the wall quickly, ignoring the shouts from guards who had spotted her unauthorized exit.

The forest beyond offered temporary safety—its dense undergrowth and winding game trails making pursuit difficult. Ru Yun moved deeper into the wilderness, using every technique she knew to obscure her trail while putting maximum distance between herself and Mist Harbor.

By nightfall, she had reached a small clearing beside a stream, far enough from the town to risk a brief rest. As she drank from the clear water, Ru Yun confronted the implications of what had happened. The Order was actively hunting Crimson Cloud survivors, using specialized operatives who could identify sect-specific cultivation signatures. This wasn't routine cleanup but targeted elimination—suggesting Lin Mei's research had concerned them more than she had realized.

More immediately, Ru Yun needed to modify her cultivation base to avoid similar detection in the future. Lin Mei had included techniques for this purpose in her theoretical work, but implementing them would be challenging without guidance.

Ru Yun removed the jade pendant from beneath her clothing and studied it in the fading light. Its surface bore no markings, its power carefully contained within. Accessing its contents would require specific cultivation techniques and considerable energy—making it both a precious resource and a dangerous liability. If activated improperly, it might release an energy signature detectable for kilometers.

"Not here," Ru Yun decided, returning the pendant to its hiding place. "Not until I'm somewhere truly secure."

That night, as she made camp in a concealed hollow beneath ancient tree roots, Ru Yun began planning her next moves. Conventional cultivation centers were closed to her—the Order's influence extended throughout all major sects and academies. Minor sects might offer temporary shelter, but eventually, the Order would extend its investigation to them as well.

She needed to disappear not just physically but conceptually—to become someone the Order wouldn't think to look for. As she considered her options, Ru Yun remembered conversations with Lin Mei about regions where the Order's influence was weakest.

"The Wastes border settlements," Lin Mei had once mentioned. "Too dangerous and unprofitable for the Order to maintain strong presence. The scavengers there operate with relative freedom, provided they don't bring back anything too disruptive."

Wastes scavengers—individuals who ventured into the Shattered Wastes to harvest rare materials and artifacts, selling their findings to various buyers while maintaining careful independence from sect politics. They were viewed with suspicion by conventional cultivation society but tolerated for the valuable resources they provided.

It was a dangerous profession with high mortality rates, but it offered something Ru Yun desperately needed—anonymity. Scavengers were known by reputation and current inventory rather than background. Few asked where a scavenger had come from; what mattered was what they had found and what they were willing to sell.

Decision made, Ru Yun altered her course toward the northwest, where the Wastes borderlands began. The journey would be long and hazardous, but less dangerous than remaining within the Order's primary sphere of influence. Along the way, she would need to acquire knowledge and equipment specific to Wastes survival—and, more importantly, begin the process of transforming her cultivation base to eliminate the Crimson Cloud signature that had betrayed her.

"Remember and continue," she whispered to herself as she settled into restless sleep. The path ahead was uncertain, but the purpose remained clear—preserve Lin Mei's research, continue the work, and someday find a way to challenge the Order's monopoly on cultivation knowledge.

Little did she know that five years later, that opportunity would quite literally appear before her in the form of an unconscious cultivator with impossible meridians, discovered during a routine scavenging expedition in the depths of the Shattered Wastes.

---

In her shelter at the Wastes borderlands, Ru Yun emerged from her memories as Wei Liang showed increasing signs of consciousness. His breathing had changed rhythm, becoming more deliberate, and the diagnostic formation showed heightened activity throughout his meridian system.

Five years of preparation had led to this moment—five years of careful study, resource gathering, and identity reconstruction. The frightened sect disciple who had fled Crimson Cloud's destruction had become something else entirely—a respected Wastes scavenger with specialized knowledge and carefully cultivated independence.

And now, as Wei Liang approached awakening, Ru Yun prepared to fulfill the promise she had made beside Lin Mei's empty laboratory: Remember and continue. The knowledge the Order had tried to destroy lived on, not just in the jade pendant she still carried but in the transformed cultivator before her—living proof that integration was possible where the Order insisted only separation could exist.

"Wake up, Wei Liang," Ru Yun murmured, adjusting the diagnostic formation to capture every detail of his transition to consciousness. "We have much to discuss about paths the Order claims don't exist."

The violet glow of his meridians pulsed more strongly, and his eyelids began to flutter. The moment of awakening approached—and with it, the next chapter in Ru Yun's quest to continue what Lin Mei had begun.
