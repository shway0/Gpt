# Chapter 21: The Scavenger's Discovery

Ru Yun had learned long ago that survival in the Shattered Wastes demanded three things: caution, pragmatism, and the willingness to walk away from anything too good to be true. Eight years of scavenging had honed these principles into instinct, keeping her alive where countless others had perished.

Today, those instincts were screaming at her to turn around.

She crouched at the edge of a shallow depression in the twisted landscape, studying the figure sprawled unconscious at its center. A man—young, by the look of him—lay half-buried in the gray dust that covered everything in this part of the Wastes. His simple gray robes were torn and scorched, revealing glimpses of strangely discolored skin beneath. Not the mottled purple of void exposure, but something else—a network of faint luminescent lines that pulsed with a rhythm just slightly too slow to be a heartbeat.

"Definitely not natural," she murmured to herself, adjusting the protective talismans hanging from her belt. The detection charm dangling from her wrist had begun vibrating the moment she'd spotted him, warning of unusual energy patterns. Now, up close, the vibration had intensified to an almost painful degree.

Pragmatism said to leave him. Unknown energy signatures in the Wastes usually meant death for the curious. The fact that the ground around him showed signs of recent spatial distortion—ripples in reality like stone dropped in water—only reinforced this conclusion.

Yet Ru Yun remained, studying him with narrowed eyes.

There was something unusual about the energy pattern. Most void manifestations she'd encountered radiated chaotic, destructive energy—the spiritual equivalent of an infected wound. This felt different. Contained. Almost... deliberate.

She pulled a slender bronze tool from her belt—a cultivation detector salvaged from an Order patrol that hadn't been cautious enough. Extending it toward the unconscious figure, she watched as the needle spun wildly before settling on a reading that couldn't possibly be correct.

"Negative resonance?" she whispered, tapping the device to check for malfunction. "That's not possible."

Conventional cultivation created positive spiritual resonance—an accumulation of energy that strengthened the cultivator's core and expanded their capabilities. Negative resonance would imply the opposite—a consumption or inversion of spiritual energy. Such a thing violated fundamental principles of cultivation as Ru Yun understood them.

Which made it potentially valuable to the right buyer.

Pragmatism warred with opportunity as she considered her options. The man would likely die without intervention—his physical injuries, while not immediately life-threatening, would leave him vulnerable to the Wastes' many dangers. Helping him meant risk. Leaving him meant losing a potential source of valuable information.

"I must be getting soft," she muttered, reaching a decision that contradicted her own survival rules.

Ru Yun approached cautiously, detection talismans extended before her. Up close, she could see that the luminescent lines beneath his skin formed patterns reminiscent of cultivation meridians, but flowing in directions that made no sense according to conventional understanding. They pulsed with a faint glow that seemed to intensify as she drew near, as if responding to her own cultivation energy.

She knelt beside him, careful not to make direct contact yet. His breathing was shallow but steady, his pulse weak but regular. His features were unremarkable—the kind of face that would blend into any crowd. Yet there was something about his expression, even unconscious, that suggested intensity beneath the ordinary exterior.

"Who are you?" she asked the unconscious figure. "And what happened to you?"

As if in response, the man's eyes snapped open. Ru Yun jerked backward, hand flying to the spirit blade at her hip. But the man made no move to attack. He simply stared at her with eyes that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it—deep wells of darkness that contained pinpricks of distant luminescence, like stars seen from the bottom of a well.

"Can you speak?" she asked, maintaining her distance.

His lips parted, but instead of words, a sound emerged that raised the hair on Ru Yun's arms—a whisper that seemed to come from multiple throats simultaneously, layered and discordant. The sound formed no recognizable words, yet conveyed a distinct impression of pain and confusion.

The luminescent lines beneath his skin flared brightly, and he convulsed once before falling still again, eyes closing. The display lasted only seconds, but it confirmed Ru Yun's suspicion that whatever had happened to this man went far beyond ordinary void exposure or cultivation accident.

"Definitely valuable to the right buyer," she decided aloud. "Or deadly to the wrong handler."

With practiced efficiency, she removed a transportation talisman from her pack—one of her most precious possessions, salvaged from a dead Order enforcer years ago. Such talismans were rare and expensive, capable of transporting two people across significant distances without traversing the intervening space. She had saved this one for an emergency escape, but it would serve better here, avoiding the need to physically carry the man through Waste-twisted terrain.

Before activating it, she performed a final precautionary measure, placing a spiritual isolation charm on the unconscious figure. The charm—her own creation, developed through years of experimentation—would temporarily dampen any energy emissions, reducing the chance of attracting attention during transport.

"This is probably the stupidest thing I've done since trying to salvage that echo crystal from the Whispering Ruins," she told the unconscious man. "If you kill me when you wake up, I'm going to be very disappointed in my judgment."

With that, she pressed the transportation talisman to his chest, gripped his arm firmly, and channeled a precise measure of cultivation energy into the activation sigil. The world blurred around them as space folded, compressing distance into a single disorienting moment of transition.

Reality reasserted itself in a small cave set into the side of one of the more stable formations in the Wastes—a twisted spire of rock that had once been a mountain peak before the cataclysm. Ru Yun had established this place as one of several safe houses, warded with protective talismans and stocked with basic supplies. Most importantly, it was isolated from the common scavenging routes and patrol paths.

The transportation had cost her a treasured escape option, but as she studied the unconscious figure now lying on her spare bedroll, Ru Yun couldn't help feeling she'd made the right choice. Something unprecedented had happened to this man—something that might shed light on the Wastes' mysteries, or on the cultivation principles that had been lost with her sect's destruction.

Knowledge was its own form of power, after all. Sometimes the most valuable salvage wasn't objects, but information.

She set about treating his physical injuries, applying medicinal pastes to burns and binding cuts with herb-infused bandages. All the while, she maintained careful spiritual isolation, ensuring that her own cultivation energy didn't interact directly with whatever was happening in his meridians.

As she worked, Ru Yun found herself studying his face more carefully. There was something almost familiar about him, though she was certain they had never met. Perhaps he reminded her of someone from her past—from before the Order had destroyed her sect and scattered its survivors.

The House of Echoing Boughs had been known for its memory cultivation techniques, preserving and transferring spiritual impressions across generations. Ru Yun had been an inner disciple, well on her way to mastering the sect's core techniques when the Order's enforcers had arrived without warning, declaring the sect heretical for its research into memory transference.

She had survived by chance—away on a training expedition when the purge occurred. She had returned to find only ashes and bodies, the sect's vast knowledge repositories destroyed or confiscated. In the eight years since, she had built a new life as a Wastes scavenger, using her cultivation training to navigate dangers that killed most who ventured here.

But she had never stopped searching for answers about why her sect had been targeted, or for fragments of the knowledge that had been lost.

Looking at the unconscious man now, with his impossible negative resonance and meridians that flowed in defiance of conventional understanding, Ru Yun wondered if she might have found a new piece of that puzzle.

"Who are you?" she asked again, though she expected no answer. "And what have you done to yourself?"

The man's eyelids flickered, and for a moment Ru Yun thought he might regain consciousness. Instead, his lips moved slightly, forming a single word without sound: "Sutra."

The term meant nothing to Ru Yun—it could be a name, a technique, or merely a fragment of delirium. She made note of it nonetheless, adding it to her mental catalog of observations about her unusual guest.

She completed her treatment of his physical injuries and sat back, considering her next steps. The isolation charm would need renewal every few hours to maintain its effectiveness. She had enough supplies for several days, assuming his condition didn't worsen. The cave's protective wards would keep most Wastes phenomena at bay, though nothing was truly safe in this twisted landscape.

"I hope you're worth the trouble," she told the unconscious figure. "Because I've just violated about six of my own survival rules for you."

As if in response, the luminescent lines beneath his skin pulsed once, brighter than before. The detection charm at Ru Yun's wrist vibrated sharply, then cracked down the middle, its delicate mechanisms overloaded by whatever energy the man was emitting.

Ru Yun stared at the broken charm, then at the man whose impossible cultivation had destroyed a tool designed to measure even the most extreme energy fluctuations.

"Definitely worth the trouble," she decided, a grim smile forming on her lips. "And definitely dangerous."

She strengthened the isolation charm, adding a second layer of protection, then settled in to wait. Sooner or later, he would wake properly. Then she would discover whether she had salvaged a valuable source of knowledge—or invited destruction into her sanctuary.

Either way, Ru Yun had long ago accepted that the most valuable discoveries in the Shattered Wastes always carried the highest risks. That was simply the nature of this broken place, where reality itself had been wounded during the cataclysm.

And wounds, as her sect had taught, were often where the most profound truths could be found—in the spaces where wholeness had been broken, revealing what lay beneath.
