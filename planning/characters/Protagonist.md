# Protagonist Profile â€“ Wei Liang

## Core Identity

**Name**: Wei Liang  
**Age**: 20  
**Caste**: Rootless (born without spirit root or cultivation potential)  
**Former Position**: Outer disciple of the Azure Peaks Sect (servant class)  
**Current Role**: Vessel of the Forgotten Path  
**Core Traits**: Intelligent, emotionally repressed, invisible until dangerous  

## Physical Appearance

### Initial Appearance (Act I)
- Thin, unremarkable build from years of insufficient nutrition
- Plain features that people's eyes tend to slide past
- Deliberately subdued body language and minimal expressions
- Calloused hands from manual labor
- Eyes that reveal intelligence only when he believes no one is watching

### Transformation (Acts II-V)
- Progressively more unsettling presence as the Forgotten Path advances
- Subtle cracks in skin that seem to absorb rather than reflect light
- Voice that begins to have an echo-like quality, as if speaking from a distance
- Eyes that develop a void-like depth, uncomfortable to meet directly
- By final act, movement has an unnatural fluidity, as if partially disconnected from physical laws

## Psychological Profile

### Motivations
- **Primary**: Survival in a world that assigned him no value
- **Secondary**: Understanding forbidden knowledge denied to his caste
- **Tertiary**: Recognition of his existence and worth
- **Evolving**: Vengeance against those who betrayed and abandoned him
- **Final**: Dismantling the system that creates "rootless" people

### Fears
- Being forgotten completely (ironically becomes his reality through the Forgotten Path)
- Returning to powerlessness and invisibility
- Discovering that power makes him no different from his oppressors
- Losing the last fragments of his identity

### Desires
- Initially: Simple acknowledgment of his existence
- Developing: Power to ensure he can never be discarded again
- Complex: Connection without vulnerability
- Contradictory: To be both seen and untouchable

### Flaws
- Tendency to equate worth with power
- Difficulty distinguishing between justice and vengeance
- Growing emotional detachment as his power increases
- Willingness to sacrifice others who remind him of his former self

## Background and Formative Experiences

### Origin
- Born to unknown parents, likely abandoned due to lack of spirit root
- Taken in by Azure Peaks Sect as a servant/laborer
- Discovered reading ability and secretly educated himself using forbidden texts
- Developed exceptional observational skills from years of being overlooked

### Pivotal Moments Before Story
- First time using sect library after hours (age 12)
- Discovery by Elder Lin, who chose to ignore his trespassing rather than punish
- Brief connection with Lian Hesh during training exercises
- Overhearing plans to use him as expendable bait for the Wastes expedition

### The Betrayal (Story Catalyst)
- Selected for expedition to the Shattered Wastes
- Abandoned by expedition team, including Lian Hesh who remained silent
- Left to die as bait for Wastes creatures
- Encounter with Sutra and awakening of the Forgotten Path

## Relationship Dynamics

### Wei Liang & Lian Hesh
- Complex history of unspoken connection
- Her silence during his betrayal becomes the wound he can't forget
- Their confrontations center on the question of complicity vs. direct harm
- Potential for either redemption or final betrayal

### Wei Liang & Ru Yun
- Pragmatic alliance based on mutual survival
- She becomes his memory-keeper as he begins to forget
- Their relationship is defined by brutal honesty and absence of pretense
- She represents the path of cynical survival rather than vengeful destruction

### Wei Liang & Yanmei
- She sees potential for good in him that he no longer recognizes
- Represents emotional risk and hope
- Her belief in him becomes both burden and anchor
- Their relationship tests whether connection can survive transformation

### Wei Liang & Sutra
- Mentor/student dynamic that evolves into symbiosis
- Sutra guides his development while slowly consuming his identity
- Represents the seduction of power at the cost of self
- Their merging in Act IV represents the final surrender of separate identity

## Voice and Speech Patterns

### Dialogue Characteristics
- Initially sparse, economical speech from years of being ignored
- Preference for observation over participation
- Gradually develops more archaic phrasings as Sutra's influence grows
- By final act, speech becomes fragmented, with unusual pauses and emphasis

### Sample Dialogue Progression

**Act I (Early):**  
"Yes, Elder." (Outward submission while concealing thoughts)

**Act II:**  
"The sect teaches that power flows to the worthy. They never considered what happens when the unworthy take it instead." (Growing defiance)

**Act III:**  
"I remember... being someone. Before. The memories feel like they belong to another person now." (Identity fragmentation)

**Act IV:**  
"We are... I am... becoming. The path consumes and creates in equal measure." (Merging with Sutra)

**Act V:**  
"Let the world remember what it means to create something rootless. Let it remember what it means to be devoured by its creation." (Final transformation)
