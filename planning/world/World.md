# World-building – *Ashes of the Forgotten Path*

## Cultivation World Structure

### Overview
The world of *Ashes of the Forgotten Path* is a fractured, caste-bound cultivation realm where spiritual power determines one's worth and place in society. The strong dominate and literally rewrite reality, while the weak aren't even permitted to live unless they serve a purpose for those above them.

### Cultivation System

#### Spirit Roots
- **Definition**: The innate capacity to absorb and channel spiritual energy (Qi)
- **Hierarchy**:
  - **Divine Root**: Extremely rare, allows for godlike potential
  - **Heavenly Root**: Born to legacy sects, pure and powerful
  - **Superior Root**: Strong potential, worthy of inner disciple status
  - **Common Root**: Limited potential, relegated to outer disciple roles
  - **Weak Root**: Barely functional, servant class
  - **Rootless**: No cultivation potential, considered less than human

#### Cultivation Paths
- Traditional paths follow elemental affinities (wood, fire, water, metal, earth)
- Each major sect has proprietary techniques and cultivation methods
- Advancement requires breaking through successive barriers or "realms"
- Higher realms grant increased lifespan, physical enhancements, and reality manipulation

#### Spiritual Laws
- Reality can be rewritten by those of sufficient cultivation
- The Order of the Sixfold Balance maintains "harmony" through enforcing the caste system
- Qi Law scripts are used to bind, judge, and rewrite spiritual order
- Heretical paths are ruthlessly suppressed

### Social Structure

#### Caste System
1. **Heavenly Bloodlines** – Born into legacy sects with pure roots
   - Privileges: Access to all resources, automatic respect, immunity from most laws
   - Role: Future sect leaders and elders

2. **Inner Disciples** – Handpicked elites trained personally by elders
   - Privileges: Special training, premium resources, authority over lower castes
   - Role: Enforcers and potential future elders

3. **Core Disciples** – Next in line to lead sects
   - Privileges: Good resources, respect, authority within sect
   - Role: Sect management and advancement

4. **Outer Disciples** – Common cultivators under strict hierarchy
   - Privileges: Basic cultivation resources, protection of sect name
   - Role: Sect labor, missions, resource gathering

5. **Servants / Rootless** – No spirit root, no lineage, no rights
   - "Privileges": Allowed to live as long as useful
   - Role: Menial labor, expendable assets, test subjects

#### Cultural Norms
- Cultivation is meritocratic *in theory*—but in practice, lineage and spirit root quality determine worth
- Rootless individuals are anomalies, feared and despised
- Knowledge is strictly controlled; certain texts are forbidden to lower castes
- Heresy includes:
  - Reading restricted texts without status
  - Practicing non-sanctioned paths
  - Speaking of the Forgotten Age without approval

### Historical Context

#### The Forgotten Age
- A time when gods walked the world and reality was more fluid
- Ended in catastrophic conflict that shattered portions of the world
- Knowledge of this era is tightly controlled by ruling sects
- Artifacts and ruins from this time are both coveted and feared

#### The Divine War
- Conflict between godlike cultivators that reshaped the landscape
- Created areas of spiritual instability like the Shattered Wastes
- Resulted in the current power structure and cultivation hierarchy
- The true history is obscured, with official versions controlled by the Order of the Sixfold Balance

### Major Regions

#### Cultivated Lands
- Controlled territories under sect influence
- Relatively stable Qi flows and established hierarchies
- Strictly regulated cultivation and behavior

#### Border Territories
- Contested areas between major sects
- Opportunities for advancement through conflict
- Less regulated, more dangerous

#### The Shattered Wastes
- Spiritually unstable region, detailed separately in Location.md
- Avoided by most, but containing valuable resources and secrets
- Home to outcasts, criminals, and those seeking forbidden knowledge

## Metaphysical Elements

### Qi Manifestation
- Visible to cultivators as colored energy flows
- Can be manipulated to form techniques, weapons, and barriers
- Higher quality Qi appears more vibrant and dense
- Corrupted or inverted Qi appears "wrong" to cultivators, causing instinctive revulsion

### Memory and Identity
- In this world, memory has tangible spiritual weight
- One's identity can be literally erased or altered through high-level techniques
- The Forgotten Path inverts this principle, consuming memory to fuel power

### Spiritual Corruption
- Occurs when Qi flows are disrupted or inverted
- Can transform cultivators into monstrosities
- The Forgotten Path is considered the ultimate corruption, as it inverts the natural order

## Technological Level
- Primarily pre-industrial with cultivation-enhanced capabilities
- Spirit tools replace modern technology (communication talismans, transportation formations)
- Architecture blends natural and supernatural elements (floating pavilions, mountains carved into palaces)
- Medicine combines herbalism with spiritual healing techniques

## Environmental Features
- Spiritual energy concentrates in natural formations (mountains, lakes, ancient forests)
- Ley lines of Qi flow throughout the world, with intersections being particularly valuable
- Weather can be influenced by powerful cultivation or spiritual disturbances
- Flora and fauna can evolve spiritual awareness and abilities when exposed to concentrated Qi
