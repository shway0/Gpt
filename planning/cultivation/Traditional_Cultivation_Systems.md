# Traditional Cultivation Systems

## Overview of Major Cultivation Paths

In contrast to the Forgotten Path's inverse nature, traditional cultivation in the world of *Ashes of the Forgotten Path* follows established principles of spiritual accumulation, refinement, and ascension. This document outlines the major cultivation systems that form the foundation of the cultivation world's power structure.

## Core Principles of Traditional Cultivation

### Fundamental Concepts

1. **Spirit Roots**: Innate channels that allow absorption and circulation of natural Qi
2. **Meridians**: Pathways through which Qi flows within the cultivator's body
3. **Dantian**: Energy center where Qi is stored and refined
4. **Cultivation Realms**: Distinct stages of advancement marked by breakthroughs
5. **Dao Resonance**: Alignment with fundamental principles of reality

### Universal Progression Pattern

Despite variations between paths, most traditional cultivation follows this general progression:

1. **Qi Gathering**: Absorbing external energy into the body
2. **Meridian Opening**: Expanding internal pathways to handle greater energy
3. **Core Formation**: Establishing a stable energy center
4. **Domain Establishment**: Extending influence beyond physical body
5. **Law Comprehension**: Understanding and manipulating fundamental principles
6. **Transcendence**: Moving beyond mortal limitations

**Unique Aspects**:

**Relationship to Caste System**:
Azure Peaks Sect is particularly rigid in its adherence to the cultivation hierarchy, believing it reflects the natural order of heaven. Their techniques work best for those with pure spirit roots, reinforcing their belief in the inherent superiority of those born with cultivation talent.

**Vulnerability to Forgotten Path**:
The Forgotten Path's nature as an inversion of established principles makes it particularly disruptive to Azure Peaks techniques, which rely on cosmic harmony. Wei Liang's development represents a fundamental challenge to their worldview.

The Order serves as both the theoretical foundation and enforcement arm of the current cultivation hierarchy. Their techniques work by imposing order and structure, making them natural enemies of anything that operates outside established parameters.

### House of Echoing Boughs (Destroyed): Memory Cultivation

**Destruction Context**:
The House was destroyed by the Order of the Sixfold Balance for allegedly preserving forbidden knowledge from the Forgotten Age. Ru Yun is one of the few survivors, carrying fragments of their techniques.

**Relevance to Wei Liang**:
The Memory Cultivation techniques represent a potential counterbalance to the memory-consuming nature of the Forgotten Path, making Ru Yun's knowledge particularly valuable to Wei as his memories fragment.

## Contrast with the Forgotten Path

### Philosophical Opposition

**Traditional Cultivation**:
- Builds upon established foundations
- Accumulates and refines energy
- Follows recognized patterns and precedents
- Advances through addition and enhancement

**The Forgotten Path**:
- Inverts established principles
- Consumes and hollows out
- Creates new patterns through negation
- Advances through subtraction and emptying

### Practical Interactions

When traditional cultivation techniques encounter the Forgotten Path:

1. **Energy Disruption**: Traditional Qi circulation patterns become unstable
2. **Technique Failure**: Established methods may fail or backfire
3. **Core Instability**: Energy centers may experience drainage or corruption
4. **Domain Collapse**: Areas of influence may shatter or invert
5. **Conceptual Confusion**: Understanding of spiritual laws becomes uncertain

This fundamental incompatibility explains why the cultivation world views the Forgotten Path with such fear and hostility—it represents not just a different approach, but a direct challenge to the foundations upon which their power is built.
